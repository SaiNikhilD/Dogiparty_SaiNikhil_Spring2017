    "There are three categories of json files in this folder. They are identified by the key called “term” in each of the json file.  Create a folder structure to read all these json files and store them into these separate folders. You are expected to create a hierarchy of folder structure.  Example:  You can place all restaurants json files in a particular country (say Australia) in the same folder. How you group the json files and create a folder structure is your choice. Your task is to identify criteria by which you can group all these json files and store them.  (You could use these keys to create hierarchy and store json files: Country, city, categories)"
