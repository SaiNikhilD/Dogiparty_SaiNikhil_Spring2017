Earlier this season, in the same space, Tadeusz Kantor led his ensemble through a symbolic re-enactment of his life and times in 20th-century Poland. Starting Thursday, in a striking change of pace, the stage is being transformed into Harlem's legendary Cotton Club. In place of the tradi-tional banks of seats there will be tables and chairs. A large mirrored ball will hang from the ceiling, and on stage will be tap-happy dancers, the spangled Soubrettes, blues singers and vaudeville comedians, re-creating roles played at the original Cotton Club by such stars as Duke Ellington, Lena Horne and Cab Calloway. During the intermission, theatergoers will be invited to dance on stage. Actually the show will be a re-creation of a re-creation. Eleven years ago, Ellen Stewart presented her first ''Cotton Club-Gala.'' Some of the acts have changed, but the concept remains the same - a celebration of elegant nights uptown.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"LA MAM TAKES A BREAK FROM THE AVANT-GARDE"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"COTTON CLUB-GALA (PLAY)"},{"name":"persons","value":"STEWART, ELLEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"THEATER"}],"pub_date":"1985-12-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Arts; Theater","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Mel","rank":1,"lastname":"GUSSOW"}],"original":"By MEL GUSSOW"},"type_of_material":"Interview","_id":"4fd15dde8eb7c8105d645d29","word_count":1774,"slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
