Hugh Jackman, Wolverine of ''X-Men,'' had a combative, compulsive snarl. He came to life when prodded to fight.

Parker, a collection of cozy Christmas stories from Mary Higgins Clark. Some find riskier ways of taking a stretch, from writing out of genre to starting a new series, but only a real daredevil would chance switching focus from a popular series sleuth to a character of the opposite sex. Ian Rankin doesn't exactly forfeit his hard-boiled cred with WITCH HUNT (Little, Brown, $19.95), but his bizarre portrait of a female assassin would surely have the manly cops in his grimly realistic Edinburgh police procedurals scratching their heads. ''Witch'' is the code name for the tall, wraithlike woman who has been working as a contract killer for almost 20 years, picking off prominent political, military and industrial figures. Her devious methods and inventive disguises have allowed this lone-wolf predator to go undetected by international law enforcement, until her uncharacteristically violent Channel crossing from Calais to Folkestone alerts agents in the Special Branch and the Secret Service to a possible terrorist attack on the heads of state at a nine-nation summit in London.","abstract":"Marilyn Stasio reviews books Witch Hunt by Ian Rankin, Melancholy Baby by Robert B Parker and The Sunday Philosophy Club by Alexander McCall Smith; photo (M)","print_page":"30","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2004\/10\/02\/books\/rankin75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2004\/10\/02\/books\/rankin75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"height":55,"subtype":"tiny_thumb","legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":55,"tinythumbheight":55,"hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image","width":55}],"headline":{"main":"Men in Women's Clothing","kicker":"CRIME"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"WITCH HUNT (BOOK)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"MELANCHOLY BABY (BOOK)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"SUNDAY PHILOSOPHY CLUB, THE (BOOK)"},{"name":"persons","value":"SMITH, ALEXANDER MCCALL"},{"name":"persons","value":"PARKER, ROBERT B"},{"name":"persons","value":"RANKIN, IAN"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}],"pub_date":"2004-10-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Book Review Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Marilyn","lastname":"Stasio"}],"original":"By Marilyn Stasio"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd23f178eb7c8105d7d5ce9","word_count":976,"slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
