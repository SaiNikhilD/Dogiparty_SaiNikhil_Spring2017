In the past he has played in world championships for his native Pakistan, and twice led his team to the final of the Bermuda Bowl, but now he was representing the United States for the first time. He and his teammates, Seymon Deutsch, Michael Rosenberg, Paul Soloway, Chip Martel and Lew Stansby, were eliminated in the semifinal, but they made an elegant fashion statement. As a tribute to Zia, they appeared one day in long white Pakistani robes. This proved difficult for Martel, who is the smallest member of the team and had been supplied with an extralarge robe. Whether to shrink the robe or enlarge Martel was the problem, and the former proved simpler.","abstract":"Alan Truscott Cards column; comments on Zia Mahmood of Manhattan, describing him as most charismatic player in world bridge championships in Tunisia last month; diagram (M)","print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Aided by 'Balmoral Coup,' Zia Sets Indian Club Slam","kicker":"CARDS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MAHMOOD, ZIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"BRIDGE (CARD GAME)"}],"pub_date":"1997-11-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts & Ideas\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"Truscott"}],"original":"By Alan Truscott"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd203de8eb7c8105d76a116","word_count":398,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9B04E4D61F39F932A3575AC0A966948260","snippet":"For the last two decades, Britain has been represented regularly in international competition by Jeremy Flint, Tony Priday and Claude Rodrigue, a consistent and effective trio.

In recent years they have often been joined by Robert Sheehan, and this foursome will be in the lists later this month in the world championships in the Netherlands. They will be joined by two talented youngsters, Roman Smolski and Tony Forrester. Like most great teams, the Flint quartet has an occasional tournament result it would prefer to forget. In the Woolwich Building Society Spring Foursomes in Eastbourne, England, this year, the Britons were eliminated from contention thanks largely to the diagramed deal, which left two famous players with red faces.","abstract":null,"print_page":"13","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Bridge: Flint Will Lead British Side In World Title Tournament","kicker":"CARDS"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"1980-09-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Alan","lastname":"TRUSCOTT"}],"original":"By ALAN TRUSCOTT"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd10d6a8eb7c8105d5c1cb8","word_count":542,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9403E1DE133DEF34BC4D53DFB667838E649EDE","snippet":"\"WHAT'S that you're reading?\" asked my wife. \"The jacket looks crazy.\" It does, too, being cartoons of two men and two women with the men's heads on the women's bodies and other surprising rearrangements.

The victory was their fourth straight and the 11th in 13 games for the Mets, who maintained a half- game lead over the Phillies and opened a game and a half lead over the Cubs in the National League East. Before the game, the Mets designated Torrez for reassignment, in effect dropping the right-handed pitcher from the roster. The Mets acquired Bruce Berenyi from the Reds Friday, and Torrez became expendable. Gooden, the 19-year-old fastball artist, struck out three batters and faced only 29 before giving way to Jesse Orosco with two out in the eighth. Orosco finished the game for his 13th save.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"YANKS WIN","kicker":"METS BEATS CARDS"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1984-06-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"William","middlename":"C.","lastname":"RHODEN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By WILLIAM C.

They won it behind the five-hit pitching of John Stuper, who also knocked in two runs with two singles. But the Cardinals, the defending champions of baseball, remained in fourth place in the National League's East, seven and a half games behind first-place Philadelphia with only 10 games to play. ''A week ago, we were only a game and a half out,'' said Whitey Herzog, the manager of the Cardinals. ''Everybody was saying we had the edge because we played our last 11 games at home. But remember what I kept saying: That, unless we played good ball in those seven final road games, the 11 at home didn't matter.
