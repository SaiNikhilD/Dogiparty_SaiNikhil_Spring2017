With her tentative movements, scrappy bangs and hard expressions, she gives us both striver and na\u00eff, a woman blind to how much she yearns for until she lands in a Manhattan of fur-trimmed coats. Peggy embodies the show's mood of gritty postwar aspiration even more than her boss, Don Draper (Jon Hamm), who has climbed so high and so fast that he is suffering from his own kind of altitude sickness. What he ends up wanting, no Diners Club card can purchase. Watching Ms. Moss, feeling her fastidiously counting the miles between the Brooklyn of Peggy's upbringing and the Manhattan of Bonwit Teller, liberal sex and reinvention, you almost hurt. She does something close to somatizing Peggy's class anxieties, and the viewer can't help reaching for the aspirin.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Roles of the Season, Maybe a Lifetime","kicker":"ELISABETH MOSS 'MAD MEN'"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2008-06-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ginia","lastname":"BELLAFANTE"}],"original":"By GINIA BELLAFANTE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27a3b8eb7c8105d83e6e2","word_count":176,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9E0CEFDB1339E333A2575BC1A9609C946297D6CF","snippet":"ADEN, June 17 -- The British lines of communication between Berbera and Bohotle, Somaliland, are threatened by the forces of the Mad Mullah.

While ''Law & Order'' has made a franchise of fictionalizing plots ripped from contemporary headlines, ''Mad Men'' uses historical news events as props to drive the running soap opera among its characters. Last year, the hopelessly ladder-climbing Pete Campbell exploited his father's death in the March 1, 1962, American Airlines crash in Jamaica Bay to try to bring the airline in as a client. This season, the agency's wooing of the crew building the new Madison Square Garden becomes a showcase for Don Draper's creative genius. ''New York City is in decay,'' he intones. ''Madison Square Garden -- it's the beginning of a new city on a hill.'' The creator of ''Mad Men,'' Matthew Weiner, is well known for being fastidious about period detail -- from the lingo and popular drinks to determining whether a guest at the wedding of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and Margaretta Murphy (known as Happy) would have been able to drive to the Sterlings' country club party later that day. So, too, with bringing actual news stories to the screen. For the Madison Square Garden episode, he dug up old ''Save Penn Station'' fliers, though the most striking -- ''Rape on 34th St'' -- was his own creation.","abstract":"Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner,
