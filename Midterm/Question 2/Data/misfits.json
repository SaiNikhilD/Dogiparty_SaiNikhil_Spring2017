Viking. $22.95 The title of the poet Mary Karr's extraordinary new memoir is taken from the name that came to be attached to the informal club formed by her father and his drinking buddies in a small Texas town in the early 60's. Days and nights they weren't working at the oil refinery or the chemical plant and could get away from their wives, they gathered at the American Legion Hall or in the back room at the local bait shop to play dominoes and tell and retell stories. Her father, says Ms. Karr, who used to tag along, told the best stories of all: stories he acted out with his consummate gift of mimicry, stories filled with unforgettable characters and terrible drama, stories that would haunt his young daughter for the rest of her life.","abstract":null,"print_page":"28","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"They're Liars, and That's Just the Least of Their Problems","kicker":"BOOKS OF THE TIMES"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"LIAR'S CLUB, THE: A MEMOIR (BOOK)"},{"name":"persons","value":"KARR, MARY"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}],"pub_date":"1995-05-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Michiko","rank":1,"lastname":"KAKUTANI"}],"original":"By MICHIKO KAKUTANI"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1f1878eb7c8105d7484d2","word_count":1228,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/12\/20\/sports\/basketball\/20roberts.html","snippet":"In surrendering their autonomy, commissioners have ultimately given up their moral authority.
