Both bands clearly idolize the Beatles' ability to wrap an effortless melody around unexpected chords and lyrics that acknowledge the complexities of relationships; both have studied and borrowed the Beatles' own chord progressions. Squeeze, however, wants to push things further. Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, Squeeze's songwriters, have a puzzle-maker's approach to pop. On the surface, the band follows the Beatles model; Mr. Tilbrook sings like a lighter-voiced Paul McCartney in tunes that chug along like 1960's pop-rock, with occasional excursions into rockabilly or quasi-country. Their unannounced project is to write songs that make unlikely chords and tunes cohere, with lyrics that intelligently anatomize romance, while sidestepping ordinary structures (like a song with verses and a bridge but no chorus), but that sound catchy anyway. Sometimes they go so far that the songs lose their pop veneer and start to ramble, but after 17 years as a band, Squeeze has learned when to hold back. And when it does indulge itself, it can always fall back on its hits.","abstract":null,"print_page":"49","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Review\/Rock; Squeeze and Skins Build on the Beatles"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"TILBROOK, GLENN"},{"name":"organizations","value":"SQUEEZE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CANDY SKINS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONCERTS AND RECITALS"}],"pub_date":"1991-10-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Jon","rank":1,"lastname":"PARELES"}],"original":"By JON PARELES"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd19c418eb7c8105d6ad82f","word_count":449,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/12\/01\/sports\/golf-daly-seems-to-breeze-in-skins.html","snippet":"With a trademark burst of power golf, John Daly dominated the opening day of the Skins Game by winning a record-tying $120,000 for the first nine holes.
