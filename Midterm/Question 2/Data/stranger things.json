Unlike Truffaut's hard-edged romantic drama, a fictional tale about the last, fatal liaison of a philandering literary celebrity, the new film, based on a true story, contains no characters who would have had any claim to fame except for the events that ended their story. On July 13, 1955, Ruth Ellis, the former hostess of a rather sleazy late-night London establishment called the Little Club, and the mother of two young children, one of whom was born out of wedlock, was hanged for the murder of David Blakely, her young, somewhat better-born lover. Though Blakely had some notoriety as an automobile racer, it was still the kind of case, according to Shelagh Delaney, who wrote the screenplay, that newspapers headlined ''Blonde Shoots Man in Hampstead.'' Ruth Ellis has gone into the archives not for what she did but for what the state did to her. She was the last woman in Britain to be sent to the gallows.","abstract":null,"print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SCREEN: 'DANCE WITH A STRANGER'"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"DANCE WITH A STRANGER (MOVIE)"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"}],"pub_date":"1985-08-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Vincent","rank":1,"lastname":"CANBY"}],"original":"By VINCENT CANBY"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd151a88eb7c8105d633873","word_count":958,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9A0DE2D91438E232A25757C2A96E9C94619FD6CF","snippet":"WESTPORT WHEN \"An April Song\" started a five-week summer theater tour \"prior to Broadway,\" its creators--  adaptor-director Albert Marre and composer Mitch Leigh--had an unusual concept in mind....","lead_paragraph":"WESTPORT WHEN \"An April Song\" started a five-week summer theater tour \"prior to Broadway,\" its creators-- adaptor-director Albert Marre and composer Mitch Leigh--had an unusual concept in mind.","abstract":"Rule, Ann: The Stranger Beside Me reviewed by Thomas Thompson","print_page":"CN12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Westport Tries Out A Troubled Play"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"THE STRANGER BESIDE ME"},{"name":"persons","value":"RULE, ANN"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOK REVIEWS"}],"pub_date":"1980-08-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Alvin","lastname":"KLEIN"}],"original":"By ALVIN KLEIN"},"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc4a86345c1498b0dac55c3","word_count":1081,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/08\/17\/books\/review\/wayfaring-stranger-by-james-lee-burke.html","snippet":"James Lee Burke\u2019s sprawling novel connects an encounter with Bonnie and Clyde to the Battle of the Bulge and the oil boom....","lead_paragraph":"James Lee Burke\u2019s sprawling novel connects an encounter with Bonnie and Clyde to the Battle of the Bulge and the oil boom.","abstract":"Stephen Harrigan reviews book Wayfaring Stranger by James Lee Burke.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2014\/08\/17\/books\/review\/17HARRIHAN\/0817-bks-Harrihan-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2014\/08\/17\/books\/review\/17HARRIHAN\/0817-bks-Harrihan-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2014\/08\/17\/books\/review\/17HARRIHAN\/0817-bks-Harrihan-articleLarge.jpg","height":604,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2014\/08\/17\/books\/review\/17HARRIHAN\/0817-bks-Harrihan-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"604"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2014\/08\/17\/books\/review\/17HARRIHAN\/0817-bks-Harrihan-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2014\/08\/17\/books\/review\/17HARRIHAN\/0817-bks-Harrihan-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"\u2018Wayfaring Stranger,\u2019 by James Lee Burke","main":"Big Mess in Texas","print_headline":"Big Mess in Texas"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","value":"Wayfaring Stranger (Book)","name":"creative_works"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","value":"Burke, James Lee","name":"persons"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"Y","value":"Books and Literature","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2014-08-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"BookReview","section_name":"Books","subsection_name":"Sunday Book Review","byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Stephen","rank":1,"lastname":"HARRIGAN"}],"original":"By STEPHEN HARRIGAN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"53ee1bf338f0d864b79c2e58","word_count":"1293","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9405EED6163BE333A25757C2A9649D946192D6CF","snippet":"A NOVEL in three parts\" (although it is actually  better described as a long short story), \"Things As They Are\" was written in 1903, six years before the \"Three Lives,\" and is now published for the first time from the manuscript owned by Carl Van ...","lead_paragraph":"A NOVEL in three parts\" (although it is actually better described as a long short story), \"Things As They Are\" was written in 1903, six years before the \"Three Lives,\" and is now published for the first time from the manuscript owned by Carl Van Vechten.
