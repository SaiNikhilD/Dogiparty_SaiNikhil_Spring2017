The employees are guys with names like Poot, Bodie and Shamrock; the funeral home is a front (their business only indirectly involves death). Their boss, the upwardly mobile, tea-sipping Stringer Bell, is telling them that although they have lost territory (that is, street corners), they can offset the loss with improved product (better drugs). At the same time, he insists on running the meeting according to Robert's Rules of Order. This results in lines like, ''Yo, yo, String -- Poot did have the floor,'' and other far less polite interjections. The bizarrely funny scene, in tonight's third-season opener of ''The Wire'' on HBO, says a lot about the show's sporadic, off-kilter humor and its consistently expansive vision. Its characters may sound generic: police officers and drug dealers on the crime-riddled streets of Baltimore, where the series is filmed. But over the last two seasons, with its frank attention to race and class, its moral ambiguity and its unabashedly confusing plots that challenge viewers to keep up, ''The Wire'' has become one of the smartest, most ambitious shows on television. With its attention to detail and its shifting points of view -- we spend equal time inside the heads of cops and criminals -- it is also one of the most novelistic, now more than ever before. This season, David Simon, the series' creator and mastermind (and a former Baltimore Sun reporter who wrote the book on which the series ''Homicide'' was based), has included episodes written by three of today's best crime novelists. In fact, the title of crime novelist doesn't really suit these writers; these are literary novelists who happen to write about criminal types, but whose work soars above genre fiction.","abstract":"Caryn James article on the emphasis on writing in The Wire, HBO series, whose third season will include episodes written by three of today's best crime novelists, George Pelecanos, Richard Price and Dennis Lehane;
