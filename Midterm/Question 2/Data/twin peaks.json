But that is what Japanese fans of \"Twin Peaks\" do on group tours to Snoqualmie, Wash., where the now-defunct ABC series was shot. They pretend to be Laura Palmer, the high school homecoming queen whose body, wrapped in plastic, is found as the series opens. Long after interest in the eerie David Lynch series has faded in the United States, Japan is in the midst of \"Peaker\" mania. Several thousand fans attended mock funerals for Laura Palmer in Tokyo and two other cities earlier this year. Some people say there has even been an increase in the popularity of cherry pie, the food favored by one of the characters, the F.B.I. agent Dale Cooper.","abstract":null,"print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Export News: 'Twin Peaks' Mania Peaks in Japan","kicker":"FILM"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME (MOVIE)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"TWIN PEAKS (TV PROGRAM)"},{"name":"persons","value":"LYNCH, DAVID"},{"name":"glocations","value":"JAPAN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SNOQUALMIE (WASH)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"}],"pub_date":"1992-08-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts & Leisure Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Andrew","rank":1,"lastname":"POLLACK"}],"original":"By ANDREW POLLACK"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1d4118eb7c8105d7111dd","word_count":974,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/05\/19\/us\/waco-texas-biker-gang-shooting.html","snippet":"The suspects faced charges of engaging in organized crime linked to capital murder in a shootout among rival gangs on Sunday in Texas....","lead_paragraph":"The suspects faced charges of engaging in organized crime linked to capital murder in a shootout among rival gangs on Sunday in Texas.","abstract":"Approximately 170 bikers linked to deadly shootout between rival motorcycle gangs during meeting at Waco, Tex, shopping mall are charged with engaging in organized crime linked to capital murder; could face death penalty depending on what charges prosecutors and a grand jury settle upon; corporate management of Twin Peaks restaurant, meeting spot where battle began, revokes franchise agreement day after melee.","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2015\/05\/19\/us\/JPWACO1\/JPWACO1-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2015\/05\/19\/us\/JPWACO1\/JPWACO1-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2015\/05\/19\/us\/JPWACO1\/JPWACO1-articleLarge.jpg","height":400,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2015\/05\/19\/us\/JPWACO1\/JPWACO1-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"400"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2015\/05\/19\/us\/JPWACO1\/JPWACO1-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2015\/05\/19\/us\/JPWACO1\/JPWACO1-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"170 Bikers Charged in Waco, in a Rivalry Rooted in the 1960s","print_headline":"170 Bikers Charged in Melee With Roots in &#8217;60s "},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","name":"subject","value":"Murders, Attempted Murders and Homicides"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","name":"subject","value":"Gangs"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"Y","name":"subject","value":"Restaurants"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"Y","name":"subject","value":"Motorcycles, Motor Bikes and Motorscooters"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","name":"organizations","value":"Bandidos Motorcycle Club"},{"rank":"6","is_major":"N","name":"organizations","value":"Cossacks Motorcycle Club"},{"rank":"7","is_major":"Y","name":"organizations","value":"Twin Peaks Restaurants"},{"rank":"8","is_major":"Y","name":"glocations","value":"Waco (Tex)"}],"pub_date":"2015-05-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"Manny Fernandez reported from Waco, Serge F.
