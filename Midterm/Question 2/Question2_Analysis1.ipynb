      "After the Fall The sound of hammers chipping at concrete greets visitors to the latest show at the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm. It is the recorded sound of the hundreds of people who demolished the Berlin Wall in 1989, and it is the introduction to an exhibition that illuminates the work of artists from the former Soviet bloc since the fall of Communism. Continuing through Jan. 16, the exhibition, ''After the Wall,'' at the Moderna Museet, assembles works by 140 artists from 22 countries. By the Bay The premiere of ''Dead Man Walking,'' based on the book by Sister Helen Prejean, will be a highlight of the 78th season of the San Francisco Opera.

      "Jack Nicklaus is threatening to make the 46th year of his life the most memorable to date - a year when this once young, strong, heroic golfer makes middle age a time of even bigger heroics. He continued this trend today when he dropped a slippery, downhill, 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole to gain a tie for the lead halfway through his own tournament on his own course -the Memorial tournament at Muirfield Village Golf Club. When he became the oldest Masters winner last month, Nicklaus could have rested on his laurels for the rest of the year and longer without diminishing his stature as one of the game's greatest players. But here he is tied at eight-under-par 136 with Dan Halldorson of Canada, who is 34 years old; Don Pooley, also 34, and Doug Tewell, who is 36.\n",

      "Whenever authors of crime fiction feel like taking a break from the old grind, they usually put on a smiley face -- a children's book from Tony Hillerman, a cookbook from Robert B. Parker, a collection of cozy Christmas stories from Mary Higgins Clark. Some find riskier ways of taking a stretch, from writing out of genre to starting a new series, but only a real daredevil would chance switching focus from a popular series sleuth to a character of the opposite sex. Ian Rankin doesn't exactly forfeit his hard-boiled cred with WITCH HUNT (Little, Brown, $19.95), but his bizarre portrait of a female assassin would surely have the manly cops in his grimly realistic Edinburgh police procedurals scratching their heads. ''Witch'' is the code name for the tall, wraithlike woman who has been working as a contract killer for almost 20 years, picking off prominent political, military and industrial figures. Her devious methods and inventive disguises have allowed this lone-wolf predator to go undetected by international law enforcement, until her uncharacteristically violent Channel crossing from Calais to Folkestone alerts agents in the Special Branch and the Secret Service to a possible terrorist attack on the heads of state at a nine-nation summit in London.\n",

      "FLOOD--Charles Andrew, 77, died at his home in New York City on December 23 with his adored wife Kristin by his side. Born in New York City, Charlie was a graduate of Riverdale Country Day School and Amherst College. He spent his early investment career at M.A. Shapiro, New Court Securities, and E.M. Warburg Pincus. For the past 32 years, Charlie and Kristin were business partners of Flood Gamble Associates, an investment management firm. Recently, Flood Gamble joined American Capital Management. Charlie was a dedicated and scrupulously honest businessperson who brought his deep intelligence to his tireless work for his clients. He enjoyed getting to know people of all backgrounds and loved nothing more than the everyday banter he had with friends, clients, neighbors, and everyone he encountered. He had a unique sense of humor and enjoyed gently ribbing people. His weekends were spent gardening and doing chores-Charlie's way of relaxing-in their second home and beloved community of Hudson, New York. Charlie loved the Hudson Valley and, with Kristin, was dedicated to the protection of the Hudson River and its environs. A lifelong Democrat and avid Obama supporter, Charlie enjoyed talking politics and railing against what he felt were the wrongs in society. He also contributed to many social causes. Charlie learned guitar as an adult and his playing and singing were an integral part of his time spent with family. A much-loved spouse, father, and grandfather, Charlie will be greatly missed by his wife of 40 years, Kristin Gamble, his daughters Deborah Flood and Karen Flood, his son-in-law Michael Benedek, and his grandchildren Naomi, Oscar and Violet. A celebration of Charlie will be held at 4:30pm on January 7 at the Metropolitan Club at 1 East 60th Street in New York City.

      "FLOOD--Charles Andrew, 77, died at his home in New York City on December 23 with his adored wife Kristin by his side. Born in New York City, Charlie was a graduate of Riverdale Country Day School and Amherst College. He spent his early investment career at M.A. Shapiro, New Court Securities, and E.M. Warburg Pincus. For the past 32 years, Charlie and Kristin were business partners of Flood Gamble Associates, an investment management firm. Recently, Flood Gamble joined American Capital Management. Charlie was a dedicated and scrupulously honest businessperson who brought his deep intelligence to his tireless work for his clients. He enjoyed getting to know people of all backgrounds and loved nothing more than the everyday banter he had with friends, clients, neighbors, and everyone he encountered. He had a unique sense of humor and enjoyed gently ribbing people. His weekends were spent gardening and doing chores-Charlie's way of relaxing-in their second home and beloved community of Hudson, New York. Charlie loved the Hudson Valley and, with Kristin, was dedicated to the protection of the Hudson River and its environs. A lifelong Democrat and avid Obama supporter, Charlie enjoyed talking politics and railing against what he felt were the wrongs in society. He also contributed to many social causes. Charlie learned guitar as an adult and his playing and singing were an integral part of his time spent with family. A much-loved spouse, father, and grandfather, Charlie will be greatly missed by his wife of 40 years, Kristin Gamble, his daughters Deborah Flood and Karen Flood, his son-in-law Michael Benedek, and his grandchildren Naomi, Oscar and Violet. A celebration of Charlie will be held at 4:30pm on January 7 at the Metropolitan Club at 1 East 60th Street in New York City. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to Scenic Hudson at http://www.scenic hudson.org/donate, or Scenic Hudson, Attn: Veronica Renzo, One Civic Center Plaza, Suite 200, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601. 1/3\n",

      "HARTE--Judith Shereff, of Livingston, NJ, passed away in New York City on Wednesday, December 30, 2015 after a long and courageous fight with lung cancer. She was 77. Judi was an amazing mother, grandmother, sister, and woman. She enjoyed gardening, reading, painting, sculpting, music and building and fixing things. For a small person, Judi had a huge heart and always opened up her home and her heart to help others. After Hurricane Sandy, she had many displaced people stay with her for extended periods of time and never felt like it was too much; instead, she always said that she wished they would stay longer since she really enjoyed being with them and helping them. Judi was born to Abraham and Rose Shereff on June 18, 1938 in New York City and raised in Forest Hills, NY. She was preceded in death by her parents. Judi is survived by her brother and sister-in-law Richard and Susan Shereff; daughter Helaine Harte and son-in-law David Rhode, her sons and daughters-in-law Douglas and Ronni Harte and Jonathan and Belynda Harte; and the pride of her life, her grandchildren, Alex and Haleigh Harte and Tyler, Casey and Rebecca Rhode. Judi loved all animals. After being a teacher and raising her children, she worked at Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange, NJ, and spent many years rescuing and rehabilitating injured and orphaned wild animals and birds. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to The Turtle Back Zoo in Judi's honor. Funeral service will be held at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel at 630 Amsterdam Avenue in New York City at 11:30am on Sunday, January 3rd. 1/3\n",

      "KELLY--Ellsworth. The Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies (FAPE) is profoundly saddened by the loss of Ellsworth Kelly. Revered and respected throughout the world, we will be forever grateful for his generosity, for the works he gave so enthusiastically to our Foundation, and for his commitment to FAPE's mission. From a sketch on a paper napkin came the design of two magnificent wall sculptures for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which greet more than 2,000 Chinese visa applicants daily, employing the colors in our two countries' flags to honor the relationship between the U.S. and China. In Berlin, Ellsworth watched as the 40- foot-high 'Berlin Totem' he created for the U.S. Embassy soared through the air to be placed in its courtyard garden. His extraordinary lithograph, 'Leaves,' adorns the walls of 50 U.S. embassies; and he contributed to our Collection at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, as well as our millennium Gift To The Nation. He also donated the actual award that we present annually to the recipient of the Leonore and Walter Annenberg Award for Diplomacy through the Arts; the first honoree was Justice Stephen Breyer, who collaborated with Ellsworth on his site- specific installation at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in Boston. Ellsworth's last gift to FAPE was the establishment of an endowment, entitled the Ellsworth Kelly Fund for Preservation, to ensure FAPE's Collection is maintained in perpetuity at no cost to the government. Words cannot express how important Ellsworth was to FAPE. His gifts are a testament to his creativity, his genius and his extraordinary spirit. He will always remain in our memory, and his work will remind us of his belief in the importance of art as a means of freedom of expression and cross-cultural understanding. We send our deepest condolences to Jack Shear.

He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren.

Gil brought his financial acumen and keen insight to Carnegie Hall's management as a longstanding member of the Finance and Operations Committee, where he helped govern major institutional advances from the restoration of Carnegie Hall to the creation of an education center. Following his successful career in business and journalism, Gil became a celebrated scholar of Gustav Mahler, establishing the Kaplan Foundation and conducting Mahler's Second Symphony with leading orchestras around the world. Gil was invited by the Vienna Philharmonic to conduct the original version of Mahler's Second Symphony and his recordings of the Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic were very successful.

He was a gentleman in every sense of the word, dedicated, deeply loyal, a good friend, and counselor to generations of colleagues at the Starr Companies and The Starr Foundation. T.C. was born in Beijing in 1918, son of Yu Hsuen Yang (mother) and Tsing Lo (Singloh) Hsu (father), brother of the late Ta Ching (Irene) Hsu and the late Vivian Hsu Jee, and beloved \"Uncle T.C.\" to many. T.C.'s father was one of the earliest backers of Cornelius Vander Starr's businesses in Shanghai and, when Tsing Lo Hsu was killed in the early days of World War II, Mr. Starr brought T.C. to America to complete his college education. T.C. never forgot Mr. Starr's generosity and friendship and made significant contributions to Starr's organizations over the years. T.C. attended the University of Shanghai from 1936-1938 and graduated from Haverford College in 1942 with a B.S. in economics. He earned a masters degree at Columbia University in the School of Journalism in 1944 and began his career with the news department of the Chinese Information Service in New York. He returned to Shanghai to work on the Chinese edition of The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, newspapers owned by Mr. Starr. In 1947, T.C. joined the staff of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank until 1949, and then joined Starr's American International companies in Hong Kong and later San Francisco. In 1964, T.C. moved to New York to work directly with Mr. Starr on a variety of projects, including the management of The Starr Foundation, Mr. Starr's private philanthropic foundation. After Mr. Starr's death in late 1968, T.C. became President of The Starr Foundation and served in that role until 1999. T.C. remained an active director of the Foundation until his death. T.C. will be laid to rest in China. A memorial service in New York City is planned for a future date. M.R. Greenberg, Chairman The Starr Foundation 1/3\n",

      "KAPLAN--Gilbert. The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the passing of our dear friend and colleague Gilbert Kaplan, passionate music lover and devoted and beloved husband of Lena. Gil joined the Carnegie Hall Board of Trustees in 1980, and served the Hall with devotion for more than thirty-five years. Gil brought his financial acumen and keen insight to Carnegie Hall's management as a longstanding member of the Finance and Operations Committee, where he helped govern major institutional advances from the restoration of Carnegie Hall to the creation of an education center. Following his successful career in business and journalism, Gil became a celebrated scholar of Gustav Mahler, establishing the Kaplan Foundation and conducting Mahler's Second Symphony with leading orchestras around the world. Gil was invited by the Vienna Philharmonic to conduct the original version of Mahler's Second Symphony and his recordings of the Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic were very successful. Gil demonstrated his deep love and knowledge of music every season as a frequent concertgoer, and many members of the Carnegie Hall's family were honored to be guests on Gil's acclaimed radio program \"Mad About Music.\" We will always remember Gil for his warmth, musical scholarship, and his love of Carnegie Hall. We express our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Lena; his devoted children Kristina, Claude, John, and Emily; and their families and loved ones. Sanford I.

      "KAPLAN--Gilbert, died peacefully on the morning of January 1, 2016, with Lena, his wife of 45 years, and their four loving children by his side. An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it \"wrapped itself around me and never let go.\" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard. His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren. All grieve profoundly at his passing, but feel deeply blessed to have loved and been loved by this remarkable man. The family will receive friends at the Frank E.

She is survived by her children, Anne Davis and Peter (both widowed), grandchildren Ariel Morvan, David and Zoe, and three great-grandchildren, Eleanor, Angelica and Benjamin. Adele studied dramatic arts at NYU, acted briefly, and was passionate about music, art and travel.

While her children were growing up in Scarsdale, NY, she was an officer of the PTA, served as co-leader of a Girl Scout troop and hosted a foreign exchange student, Delcia Bence Rusk, to whom she remained close all her life. In a brief reprise of her acting career, she played Mrs. Frank in a 1961 Scarsdale High School production of The Diary of Anne Frank in which her daughter, Anne, was played by Liza Minnelli in her acting debut. A lover of music and constant concertgoer, she was an active Board Member of Young Audiences, the Bowden International Music Festival, and the Marlboro Music Festival, which she attended for over forty years.

      "TRYFOROS--Nicholas James, July 27, 1923-December 31, 2015. Nicholas James Tryforos, son of James and Garufa, was the youngest and last survivor of thirteen children. In explaining why \"Mama and Papa had thirteen children, not twelve or fourteen\" Nick said, \"When I was born, papa picked me up, checked me out, and said 'Mama! FINALLY a perfect baby.'\" A lifelong New Yorker, he was a proud graduate of The Greek American Institute, Theodore Roosevelt High School and New York University. He served in the Army in WWII. After basic training, the Army sent him to language school to become a Hindustani interpreter. He received horse cavalry and military intelligence training, and then served in the Philippines and in General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo during the occupation of Japan. Nick used his Hindustani skills for the rest of his life to surprise and delight both friends and complete strangers from India. After returning from Japan Nick worked for 15 years in the family flower and novelty business, then had a 25-year career with the IRS, retiring in 1986 as a Group Manager, supervising large corporation tax audits. Amateur gymnast, superb photographer, family documenter and archivist, Nick was the favorite uncle of many and worked hard to make and cultivate relationships with family and friends. He collected any piece of junk that could potentially serve a future purpose, taught his children the value of a dollar and the importance of grunt labor, and was the original tiger mom and DIY guy. He was the resident teaser (while being wheeled to major surgery with four children at home, Nick whispered to his wife \"don't worry dear, as long as we have our health!\") and an inveterate joke teller (\"Have you heard the one about the skeleton that walked into a bar...\"). Nick delighted in meeting his children's friends, showing them photos related (and unrelated!) to their discussion, and always enjoyed giving them another tour of the garage! Nick was quietly proud of everyone in his family, and his family was very fortunate to have him. He leaves behind his dear wife of 63 years and best friend Mary, and his children, Margaret and her husband Paul, Jim and his wife Sue, Tom, and Tina and her husband David. He also leaves his grandchildren, Peter, Evan, Kate and her husband Pat, John, Lucas, Eva, and Eli, and great-grandson Theo. Within minutes of Nick's passing, his second great-grandson, Grant, was born. Visitation will be held from 6 to 9pm Monday, January 4th at Frederick Funeral Home in Flushing, and funeral services at 11:30am Tuesday at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in Flushing.

      "BOESCHENSTEIN--Josephine Moll, \"Molly.\" October 29, 1930-December 30, 2015. Josephine Moll \"Molly\" Boeschenstein passed away peacefully Wednesday, December 30, 2015, in Hobe Sound, FL. Molly was born Josephine Hamlin Moll on October 29, 1930, in Detroit, MI, to Josephine Hamlin and The Honorable Lester Moll, a prominent Detroit prosecutor and judge. She grew up in Grosse Pointe, MI. In 1953, she married William W. Boeschenstein, who was working for Owens Corning in Detroit. The couple later moved to Perrysburg, Ohio, where they raised four sons. Mr. Boeschenstein ultimately became Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Owens Corning in Toledo, Ohio. Although her husband became the public face of the company, Molly was a genuine partner to him throughout his career. Molly was known for her intelligence, style, love of competition, and her outstanding, irreverent sense of humor. Conversations with her were punctuated by astute observations, humorous ripostes, and often times belly shaking laughter. She had a wide and deep circle of friends from every corner of her life. Molly was deeply involved in a number of civic and charitable organizations. Notably, she was the first President of the St. Vincent Medical Center Foundation in Toledo, OH, a committed volunteer at the Toledo Museum of Art, and a member of the Board of Directors of The National Council on Alcoholism and Addiction and The Freedom Institute in New York. Molly and her husband have made their principal residence in Hobe Sound, FL. She is survived by her husband of 62 years, William W. Boeschenstein, sons William Jr., Michael, Peter and Stephen, their spouses, and 10 grandchildren and one great- grandchild. Funeral services are pending. Memorial contributions may be made to the Toledo Museum of Art, the Jupiter Medical Center Foundation in Jupiter, FL or the Martin Health Foundation in Stuart, FL. 1/3\n",

An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it \"wrapped itself around me and never let go.\" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard. His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren. All grieve profoundly at his passing, but feel deeply blessed to have loved and been loved by this remarkable man. The family will receive friends at the Frank E.

He was five days short of his 93rd birthday. Eddie lived a unique and exceptional life. As a young man, Eddie fought bravely in World War II and received a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star.

By 2010, when New York-based Rosemont Real Estate acquired part ownership of BGK, Gilbert's company was the largest holder of commercial real estate in New Mexico, owning properties in 28 states.

For many, he was the lanky, redheaded and perennially boyish fashion and style reporter for The New York Times, Harper's Bazaar, Esquire and Golf. For others, he was an inspirational practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism: he brought comfort, joy and wisdom to many through his example, his guidance and his two books, \"The Buddha in Your Mirror\" and \"The Buddha in Your Rearview Mirror.\" In Sharon, CT, where he had lived since 1993, he was known as a quirky character with memorable pickup trucks (his beautiful golden retriever, Lola, nearly always along for the ride) and a passion for swimming, biking and otherwise enjoying the beauty around him. For his daughter, Kate, he was her biggest cheerleader as well as the person who always encouraged her to set a high standard and then meet it. He adored her, and she adored him. A true journalist, Woody was interested in everything; for the past few years, he was able to travel widely and meet interesting people in the company of his girlfriend, Kirsten Jensen. His daughter and former wife, Cynthia, were glad that he was able to enrich his life and expand his horizons with Kirsten before his death, from a glioblastoma tumor, on December 31.

Memorial Service Friday, January 8th, 12:00pm, Short Hills Community Congregational Church. Luncheon Friday, January 8th, after the service, Short Hills Club, 144 Highland Avenue. James C. Kellogg, philanthropist and loving husband, father of three children, and grandfather of nine grandchildren, died on Thursday of congestive heart failure, surrounded by his family. He was 76 years old. Jim was a graduate of The Pingry School, Princeton University, and Harvard Law School. During his career, he was a partner at the Manhattan law firm Townley & Updike, the President of the Community Foundation of New Jersey, the President of the J.C. Kellogg Foundation, and a valued trustee of many non-profit boards. He was most proud of his philanthropic work in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He cherished the idea of creating opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds to be healthy, learn, and grow. Jim grew up in Elizabeth, NJ and spent his summers in Bay Head, NJ, where he made many friends whom he kept throughout his life. Those friends would gather on a regular basis for couples' dinners and bridge marathons. He looked forward to Romeo lunches, Scorpions bridge, and the Literatti book club, where he always touted the latest political book. In the past few years, Jim became a Life Master at bridge by participating in ACBL bridge tournaments across the country. He spent his winters at Yeamans Hall in South Carolina. Jim had a deep commitment to public service; he advised and served on the boards of Frost Valley YMCA, Bay Head Chapel, Short Hills Community Congregational Church, Point Pleasant Hospital, the Children's Specialized Hospital, Trinitas Regional Medical Center, Meridian Health Systems, Council of Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, Union County College, Bloomfield College, the Prudential Insurance Company, New Jersey State in the Trust for Public Lands, and the Scholarship Fund for Inner City Children. He was appointed by the Governor to the boards of New Jersey Transit and the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. His lifelong passion for philanthropy paled in comparison to his love for his family- his wife, three children, and nine grandchildren. Jim was happiest at family gatherings and loved playing backgammon and gin rummy with his children and grandchildren. Pop Pop's signature backgammon move was to wait for his opponent to admit defeat only to turn the board around and play the losing side, teaching his mentee how to stage a comeback and win! He was active in every aspect of his children's and grandchildren's lives, including attending their school events, and offering advice on and help with work issues. He is survived by his wife, Gail Chambers Kellogg, his children, Jimmy Kellogg, Kate Kellogg, and Elizabeth Kellogg Winterbottom; adoring grandchildren, Emily, Jimmy and Grace Kellogg; Chris and Andrew Kellogg Peeler; Hailey, Francesca, Maile, and Penelope Winterbottom; and his three younger brothers, Peter, Kelly, and Rusty. A service to celebrate his life will be held Friday, January 8th at 12:00pm at the Short Hills Community Congregational Church. Immediately following the service, the family invites all attendees to join them for lunch at the Short Hills Club. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Frost Valley YMCA in Claryville, NY. For more info, or to send condolences to the family, please visit www.bradleyfuneral homes.com. 1/3\n",

      "KAPLAN--Gilbert, died peacefully on the morning of January 1, 2016, with Lena, his wife of 45 years, and their four loving children by his side. An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it \"wrapped itself around me and never let go.\" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard. His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren. All grieve profoundly at his passing, but feel deeply blessed to have loved and been loved by this remarkable man. The family will receive friends at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue (at 81st Street) in New York City, on Thursday, January 7 at 2-5pm and 7-9pm. Friends are invited to email stories and condolences to: gilkaplanfamily@gmail.com. 1/3\n",

      "BOULEZ--Pierre. The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall celebrate the life of our dear friend and colleague Pierre Boulez, one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th century. A legendary composer, conductor, musical philosopher and activist, Pierre Boulez was a visionary and trailblazing global force for modern music. Carnegie Hall was privileged to elect him an Honorary Trustee in 1995, and to appoint him as the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair from 1999 to 2003. Boulez made approximately 75 appearances at Carnegie Hall, conducting close to 60 performances on our stages, and his works have been performed on more than 80 programs. As an arts educator, he was inspirational-challenging audiences to explore a new aesthetic of music through his musical research center IRCAM, and, in the course of the Professional Training Workshops he led through Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute, offering profound insights to young musicians. Boulez's work in Paris served as an inspiration in the conception of Zankel Hall, the opening season of which included performances by Boulez with the Ensemble Intercontemporain. Pierre Boulez will be deeply missed by all of us at Carnegie Hall and by the entire artistic community, though his brilliant musical legacy and pioneering spirit will stay with us all. We express heartfelt condolences to his sister, Jeanne Chevalier Boulez, and brother, Roger Boulez, as well as their many children and grandchildren. Sanford I. Weill, President; Mercedes T.

An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it \"wrapped itself around me and never let go.\" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard. His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren. All grieve profoundly at his passing, but feel deeply blessed to have loved and been loved by this remarkable man. The family will receive friends at the Frank E.

Under Boulez, the Philharmonic introduced concert formats that brought the audience in direct contact with composers and performers, including the informal Rug Concerts and downtown Prospective Encounters. He returned in 1986 for a 14- event series highlighting his work as conductor, composer, and leader of the Ensemble Intercontemporain. In 1992 he celebrated the Philharmonic's 150th anniversary in a concert also led by former Music Directors Zubin Mehta and Kurt Masur. In the same year Boulez was made an Honorary Member of the Society, an honor shared by such figures as Wagner, Stravinsky, and Bernstein. New York Philharmonic Music Director Alan Gilbert said: \"Pierre Boulez was a towering and influential musical figure whose Philharmonic leadership implicitly laid down a challenge of innovation and invention that continues to inspire us to this day. To me, personally, he also was an unfailingly gracious mentor and friend, from the years when I worked with him in Cleveland and when I was appointed to the Philharmonic to the last time I saw him in Baden- Baden on a Philharmonic tour. I will miss his musicianship, kindness, and wisdom.\" The New York Philharmonic family sends our love and compassion to his family. 1/3\n",

      "KAISER--Walter, May 31, 1931 to January 5, 2016. Born in Bellevue, Ohio during the Depression, the son of a grocer, he became a page in the U.S. Senate in 1944 and then won scholarships to Philips Academy, Andover and Harvard, an institution he didn't leave until retirement. He graduated magna cum laude with highest honors in 1954, received his Ph.D. in 1960, and was made Professor of English and Comparative Literature in 1969. From 1988 to 2002 he served as Director of Villa I Tatti, the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies in Florence. His leadership profoundly shaped I Tatti, and those were among his happiest years; he always felt that he truly belonged to the northern Mediterranean, especially to Greece and Italy. His love of learning and the arts gave color and depth to every aspect of his life. Few people have been more learned or more cultivated, wittier or more awake to beauty. Fewer still have had his genius for friendship. He was extraordinarily generous with his attention, and always finding opportunities for generosity where others wouldn't have seen them. He was the best of fathers. He is survived by his children, Miranda and David, and three granddaughters; by his brother, Bob; by his many godchildren; and by hundreds of others whose lives he enriched immeasurably, as the astonishing outpouring of grief and love from around the world since his death attests. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Walter Kaiser Fund for the Biblioteca Berenson at Villa I Tatti, Harvard University. 1/3\n",

Before joining our New York appellate litigation and arbitration practice in 2009, Judith spent 25 years on the bench of the New York Court of Appeals, including the last 15 as its Chief Judge. The first woman to serve on New York's highest court, Judith earned a national reputation for her pioneering opinions and court reforms. She wrote seminal opinions on such issues as the death penalty, same-sex marriage, education and state constitutional rights while leading innovative changes to the New York court system, including the establishment of specialized courts to focus on issues of drug addiction, domestic violence and mental health. As Chief Judge, Judith created the Adoption Now program, helped establish the Center for Court Innovation and co-chaired the ABA Commission on the American Jury. She retired from the bench in 2008, having served longer than any Chief Judge in state history. At Skadden, Judith helped numerous clients navigate complex issues of New York law. She also served as a trustee of the Skadden Fellowship Foundation and continued her advocacy for families and children, including through her service as the chairwoman of the Permanent Judicial Commission on Justice for Children. Judith graduated from Barnard College ('58) and NYU School of Law ('62), where she was one of 10 women in a class of nearly 300. Judith is survived by her children, Luisa, Jonathan and Gordon, and seven grandchildren. She will be greatly missed. 1/3\n",

The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall celebrate the life of our dear friend and colleague Pierre Boulez, one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th century. A legendary composer, conductor, musical philosopher and activist, Pierre Boulez was a visionary and trailblazing global force for modern music. Carnegie Hall was privileged to elect him an Honorary Trustee in 1995, and to appoint him as the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair from 1999 to 2003. Boulez made approximately 75 appearances at Carnegie Hall, conducting close to 60 performances on our stages, and his works have been performed on more than 80 programs. As an arts educator, he was inspirational-challenging audiences to explore a new aesthetic of music through his musical research center IRCAM, and, in the course of the Professional Training Workshops he led through Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute, offering profound insights to young musicians. Boulez's work in Paris served as an inspiration in the conception of Zankel Hall, the opening season of which included performances by Boulez with the Ensemble Intercontemporain. Pierre Boulez will be deeply missed by all of us at Carnegie Hall and by the entire artistic community, though his brilliant musical legacy and pioneering spirit will stay with us all. We express heartfelt condolences to his sister, Jeanne Chevalier Boulez, and brother, Roger Boulez, as well as their many children and grandchildren. Sanford I. Weill, President; Mercedes T.

Before joining our New York appellate litigation and arbitration practice in 2009, Judith spent 25 years on the bench of the New York Court of Appeals, including the last 15 as its Chief Judge. The first woman to serve on New York's highest court, Judith earned a national reputation for her pioneering opinions and court reforms. She wrote seminal opinions on such issues as the death penalty, same-sex marriage, education and state constitutional rights while leading innovative changes to the New York court system, including the establishment of specialized courts to focus on issues of drug addiction, domestic violence and mental health. As Chief Judge, Judith created the Adoption Now program, helped establish the Center for Court Innovation and co-chaired the ABA Commission on the American Jury. She retired from the bench in 2008, having served longer than any Chief Judge in state history. At Skadden, Judith helped numerous clients navigate complex issues of New York law. She also served as a trustee of the Skadden Fellowship Foundation and continued her advocacy for families and children, including through her service as the chairwoman of the Permanent Judicial Commission on Justice for Children. Judith graduated from Barnard College ('58) and NYU School of Law ('62), where she was one of 10 women in a class of nearly 300. Judith is survived by her children, Luisa, Jonathan and Gordon, and seven grandchildren. She will be greatly missed.

She was a great friend of Fordham Law School and its alumni, particularly those serving in the state and federal judiciary. Over the years, she wrote for the Fordham Law Review and other journals, and she inspired students, graduates, and alumni with her remarks at the school's diploma ceremony, conferences, and lecture series. The school honored her in 2002 with the Fordham- Stein Prize, which is presented annually to a member of the legal profession whose work embodies the highest standards of the legal profession. In 2012, she participated in a special conversation alongside retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor that canvassed their concerns about the election of judges, the importance of civic education and involvement for lawyers, and their pathbreaking appointments as the first women to hold their respective judicial roles. In addition to her jurisprudence, her administrative impact will leave an indelible mark on the office of Chief Judge of the State of New York. We extend our deepest sympathy to her colleagues at Skadden Arps and her family. Matthew Diller, Dean Fordham Law School 1/3\n",

For many, he was the lanky, redheaded and perennially boyish fashion and style reporter for The New York Times, Harper's Bazaar, Esquire and Golf. For others, he was an inspirational practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism: he brought comfort, joy and wisdom to many through his example, his guidance and his two books, \"The Buddha in Your Mirror\" and \"The Buddha in Your Rearview Mirror.\" In Sharon, CT, where he had lived since 1993, he was known as a quirky character with memorable pickup trucks (his beautiful golden retriever, Lola, nearly always along for the ride) and a passion for swimming, biking and otherwise enjoying the beauty around him. For his daughter, Kate, he was her biggest cheerleader as well as the person who always encouraged her to set a high standard and then meet it. He adored her, and she adored him. A true journalist, Woody was interested in everything; for the past few years, he was able to travel widely and meet interesting people in the company of his girlfriend, Kirsten Jensen.

Mrs. O'Brien was born on February 13, 1919, in West Springfield, Massachusetts to Henry and Mary (Choquette) Brassard. On May 30, 1944, she married Lawrence F. O'Brien, Jr., at St. Joseph's Church in Springfield. Mr. O'Brien went on to twice serve as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, as a senior White House aide to Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, and as Commissioner of the National Basketball Association. They were married for 46 years before Mr. O'Brien passed away in New York City in September of 1990. Mrs. O'Brien resided in Washington, D.C., from 1961-1973, before moving to New York City in 1973 where she lived at 860 U.N. Plaza for more than 40 years. She spent summers at her home in the town of Cotuit on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. A thoughtful and generous philanthropist, Mrs. O'Brien was involved in the Archbishop's Christmas Appeal/Catholic Charities of New York and also supported the New York Public Library, the Cotuit Library Association in Barnstable on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and the Environmental Film Festival in Washington, D.C. Mrs. O'Brien was instrumental in creating the \"Lawrence F. O'Brien Gallery\" exhibit space within the National Archives in Washington, D.C. She was fiercely loyal to her family and friends, possessed a keen sense of humor and was a person inclined to speak her mind. Her passion for books and for reading was legendary.

      "BERG--Ivar E. (1929-2016), an Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, who made important contributions to the study of higher education, labor markets and industrial sociology, died on January 1, 2016. Dr. Berg's classic book, Education and Jobs: The Great Training Robbery (1970) cast doubt on economists' assertions that people with more education earn more because they are more skilled and productive; instead, employers frequently hire people to work in jobs that do not make use of their education. His book played a major role in a landmark civil rights decision by the U. S. Supreme Court, Griggs vs. Duke Power Company (1971) and was credited with providing the bases of the theory of market signaling, for which Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics. Among his many honors, he was elected a Fellow of the International Academy of Management, which cited him as \"one of the seminal figures in the sociological study of labor markets and the founder of economic sociology.\" Born January 3, 1929 in Brooklyn, NY, he earned his AB at Colgate and his doctorate at Harvard. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps, retiring as a major, and on the faculties of Columbia and Vanderbilt, in addition to Penn. Dr. Berg, author of more than 70 articles and chapters and dozen books, leaves a wife, Sharon (Calli) Berg, a son and daughter-in-law, Geoffrey and Amy Berg, and stepsons Tim Smallwood (and his wife, Staci Smallwood) and Jim Smallwood (and his fiance, Catta Keith). 1/3\n",

We recognize and celebrate that no one has had a more profound, positive impact on our court system. She was New York's first female, and longest serving, Chief Judge, and used her matchless energy and wisdom, heart and soul, to reshape the courts to improve the lives of countless people. She pioneered court innovations based on the premise that the legal system exists to serve the people with fairness and sensitivity. For this she was beloved, nationally and internationally. She neither sought nor basked in the accolades, acknowledging them with a shy smile and a handwritten note combining modesty and gratitude. She could be hilariously funny, but never at anyone else's expense. It is fitting that her memorial service will be held at Lincoln Center as the arts were important in her life, and she could be heard singing in the courthouse corridors. Judith once said she has a 5 to 9 job, arriving at 5am (often with grandmother photos to exchange with maintenance staff) leaving at 9pm, and yet she was always able to be there, undistracted, for her family and friends. Though as a historical society we focus on figures from the past, we were so fortunate to have had one of the nations' leading lights in our midst. She battled her illness with courage and dignity. It seemed to us that the day of her passing would somehow never come. But she was, after all, human. The Historical Society of the New York Courts 1/3\n",

Before joining our New York appellate litigation and arbitration practice in 2009, Judith spent 25 years on the bench of the New York Court of Appeals, including the last 15 as its Chief Judge. The first woman to serve on New York's highest court, Judith earned a national reputation for her pioneering opinions and court reforms. She wrote seminal opinions on such issues as the death penalty, same-sex marriage, education and state constitutional rights while leading innovative changes to the New York court system, including the establishment of specialized courts to focus on issues of drug addiction, domestic violence and mental health. As Chief Judge, Judith created the Adoption Now program, helped establish the Center for Court Innovation and co-chaired the ABA Commission on the American Jury. She retired from the bench in 2008, having served longer than any Chief Judge in state history. At Skadden, Judith helped numerous clients navigate complex issues of New York law. She also served as a trustee of the Skadden Fellowship Foundation and continued her advocacy for families and children, including through her service as the chairwoman of the Permanent Judicial Commission on Justice for Children. Judith graduated from Barnard College ('58) and NYU School of Law ('62), where she was one of 10 women in a class of nearly 300.

      "PRESENT-- Dr. Daniel H. A brilliant, creative, and abundantly loved giant has left us. Dr. Daniel H. Present, born April 3, 1934, passed away on January 12th from complication of Parkinson's Disease. He was 81 years old. His passing will be deeply mourned by Jane Werner Present, his wife, partner, lover and best friend of more than 59 years, his three children, their spouses, and four grandchildren, Tracy Present, Stephanie, Michael, Billy and Katherine Podalak, Douglas, Susan, Adam and Margot Present, and his sister Judy Present Liss; his friends, associates and the thousands of lives he touched during his 50 years of practice. Dan graduated from Syracuse University Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 and State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, Magna Cum Laude, in 1959. He completed an internship, medical residency, Gastroenterology residency and GI Fellowship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and entered private practice in 1964, where he quickly began to focus his attention on the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He was the recipient of the first research award given by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Dan brought clinical trials into clinical practice. His first paper was accepted for publication in 1966. He subsequently published 329 papers. At the time of his retirement, his publications had been cited more than 15,000 times. During his 54 years at Mt. Sinai, he served as President of both the Association of the Attending Staff and the Alumni Association for which he received the coveted Jacobi Medallion for Conspicuous Service to the Alumni. Dan received every award in his field including the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award, The American Gastroenterology Association Distinguished Clinician Award, Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, The WiIIiam Dock, M.D. Master Teacher Award in Medicine State University of New York, the Janssen Award for Outstanding Achievement Award in Clinical Gastroenterology, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Arents Award for Excellence in Medicine, the highest achievement awarded by Syracuse University. He is generally recognized as having pioneered the way Crohn's disease is treated. More than any recognition, Dan loved taking care of his patients. He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Funeral services will be held on Thursday at 12pm at \"The Riverside,\" 180 West 76th St., New York. Contributions in Dan's memory may be made to the Present-Levison Fellowship at Mt. Sinai, and sent to the Division of Gastroenterology, Mt. Sinai Hospital, Box 1069, New York, New York 10029. 1/3\n",

      "HAGOPIAN--Louis Thomas. Of Vero Beach, FL and Darien, CT, died after a short illness in his Florida home on January 9, 2016 at age 90. He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Joanne Kelly Hagopian; his daughter Susan Goddard and sons Thomas and Matthew; nine grandchildren; his sister Helen Geovjian; and more than 40 members of his extended family. Lou thought himself to be one of the luckiest men in the world, with a wife and family who loved him and whom he loved dearly, parents he respected and adored and a career he both enjoyed and succeeded in beyond his wildest hopes. As the son of parents who fled to the United States after their families were killed in the Armenian Genocide, he felt that he truly lived the American Dream and loved this country for it. Lou served in the US Navy during World War II and graduated from Michigan State University after the War. His career started in the auto business, but his skills in marketing and communications soon led him to a successful career in advertising with the oldest agency in the US, NW Ayer. He led NW Ayer for over 25 years, including the last ten as Chairman and CEO. During his tenure, Ayer was selected Agency of the Year and developed numerous iconic advertising campaigns with taglines such as \"A Diamond is Forever\" and \"Be All That You Can Be.\" He also was Chairman of the Advertising Association of America and a founding member of the innovative Partnership for Drug-Free America. Lou was a man of style with an enormous heart, tremendous charm and a wicked wit. He loved to serenade his wife, Joanne, with \"Misty\" or \"My Funny Valentine\" whenever given the slightest excuse (and often without). An avid and excellent golfer for over 70 years, he started as a caddy at the Pine Lake Country Club outside of Detroit and ended as a member of the Royal & Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews (where he won the Seniors Tournament at the age of 86). Services will be held at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in Darien, CT at 10:30am on Saturday, January 16. A memorial service will also be scheduled for friends and relatives in Vero Beach in the next several weeks.

He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, then graduated from New York University (1948), Phi Beta Kappa, and entered the graduate program at Harvard (Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, 1954), where he wrote a prize-winning essay on Shakespeare. He spent his entire teaching career at Tufts University (1954-84), serving twice as chair of the Department of English. He published a number of essays in scholarly journals, a popular introduction to Shakespeare, and he served as General Editor of The Signet Classic Shakespeare, a paperback series (one play per volume) that is widely used in colleges and universities. He was also the author or co-author of several widely used textbooks-on argument (with Hugo Bedau, late of the Tufts Department of Philosophy), art, composition, drama, and literature, including \"A Short Guide to Writing about Art\" (now in its 11th edition), and \"Introduction to Literature\" (16th edition). In 1963, he and William Burto (his partner since 1952, deceased 2013) developed an interest in Japanese art, especially calligraphy, and they went on to build a collection that was exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery, the Harvard Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art, Houston. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog by Miyeko Murase, \"The Written Image\" (2002), to which Barnet and Burto contributed two essays, one on collecting, the other on looking at calligraphy from a Western point of view. (After Burto's death their collection was divided among the first four of these museums.) He and Burto also wrote \"Zen Ink Paintings\" (1982) as well as several essays on Japanese art. As a teacher of English literature, he was familiar with a good deal of writing about death. Among the favorite passages he carried in his head-he could not understand why some educators disparage \"rote memory\"-were Shakespeare's \"Golden lads and girls all must/As chimney sweepers come to dust.\" and this epitaph by Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), \"Upon the Death of Sir Albert Morton's Wife\": \"He first deceased; she for a little tried/To live without him, liked it not, and died.\" (Barnet said, shortly after the death of his partner, that Wotton's lines came to his mind every day, and that he regretted, every day, his inability to re-enact them.) He leaves his sister-in-law Saretta Barnet, a niece and three nephews and their spouses, nine grandnephews and nieces, a great-grandnephew and niece, and his longtime friend, Morton Berman. Most of his estate was bequeathed to a scholarship fund at Tufts, in honor of his parents, Philip and Esther Barnet. By his wish there will be no services. 1/3\n",

      "PRESENT--Daniel H.,M.D. We at the Mount Sinai Health System are saddened by the passing of Daniel H. Present, M.D., a beloved physician who, in a five-decade career at Mount Sinai, was at the forefront of research into the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Dr. Present was the first researcher to show the effectiveness of an immunosuppressant, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), in fighting Crohn's disease. When Dr. Present published his results in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 1980, it changed the lives of thousands of Crohn's patients. Later, he studied the use of cyclosporine for severe steroid- refractory ulcerative colitis, and demonstrated that it could help avoid or delay colectomies in many of these seriously ill patients. In a third breakthrough in the late 1990s, Dr. Present studied cA2, also known as infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody, and showed, in another seminal paper in the NEJM, that it could help close fistulas in Crohn's patients. Early in his career at Mount Sinai, he was mentored by Henry D. Janowitz, M.D., for whom the Division of Gastroenterology is named. Dr. Present was also a talented clinician who cared for thousands of patients over his career. Over a decade ago, he and his wife, Jane, established an endowed fellowship at Mount Sinai to train graduates from outside institutions to become experts in the care of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Dr. and Mrs. Present also maintained a foundation for clinical research of IBD. Upon his retirement from Mount Sinai in 2014, the foundation donated its principal in support of The Susan and Leonard Feinstein Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinical Center at Mount Sinai. We extend our deepest sympathies to Jane and their children, Douglas, Stephanie, and Tracy, at this difficult time. Peter W. May, Chairman, Boards of Trustees, Mount Sinai Health System Kenneth L.

Clinical Professor of Medicine, Dr. Present combined an active clinical practice with prolific ground-breaking research in Gastroenterology. In the tradition of Drs. Crohn, Ginsberg, and Oppenheimer, he continued Mount Sinai's pioneering work in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases.

      "BARNET--Sylvan, born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 11, 1926, died at home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 9, 2016. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, then graduated from New York University (1948), Phi Beta Kappa, and entered the graduate program at Harvard (Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, 1954), where he wrote a prize-winning essay on Shakespeare. He spent his entire teaching career at Tufts University (1954-84), serving twice as chair of the Department of English. He published a number of essays in scholarly journals, a popular introduction to Shakespeare, and he served as General Editor of The Signet Classic Shakespeare, a paperback series (one play per volume) that is widely used in colleges and universities. He was also the author or co-author of several widely used textbooks-on argument (with Hugo Bedau, late of the Tufts Department of Philosophy), art, composition, drama, and literature, including \"A Short Guide to Writing about Art\" (now in its 11th edition), and \"Introduction to Literature\" (16th edition). In 1963, he and William Burto (his partner since 1952, deceased 2013) developed an interest in Japanese art, especially calligraphy, and they went on to build a collection that was exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery, the Harvard Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art, Houston. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog by Miyeko Murase, \"The Written Image\" (2002), to which Barnet and Burto contributed two essays, one on collecting, the other on looking at calligraphy from a Western point of view. (After Burto's death their collection was divided among the first four of these museums.) He and Burto also wrote \"Zen Ink Paintings\" (1982) as well as several essays on Japanese art. As a teacher of English literature, he was familiar with a good deal of writing about death. Among the favorite passages he carried in his head-he could not understand why some educators disparage \"rote memory\"-were Shakespeare's \"Golden lads and girls all must/As chimney sweepers come to dust.\" and this epitaph by Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), \"Upon the Death of Sir Albert Morton's Wife\": \"He first deceased; she for a little tried/To live without him, liked it not, and died.\" (Barnet said, shortly after the death of his partner, that Wotton's lines came to his mind every day, and that he regretted, every day, his inability to re-enact them.) He leaves his sister-in-law Saretta Barnet, a niece and three nephews and their spouses, nine grandnephews and nieces, a great-grandnephew and niece, and his longtime friend, Morton Berman. Most of his estate was bequeathed to a scholarship fund at Tufts, in honor of his parents, Philip and Esther Barnet. By his wish there will be no services. 1/3\n",

Present, born April 3, 1934, passed away on January 12th from complication of Parkinson's Disease. He was 81 years old. His passing will be deeply mourned by Jane Werner Present, his wife, partner, lover and best friend of more than 59 years, his three children, their spouses, and four grandchildren, Tracy Present, Stephanie, Michael, Billy and Katherine Podalak, Douglas, Susan, Adam and Margot Present, and his sister Judy Present Liss; his friends, associates and the thousands of lives he touched during his 50 years of practice. Dan graduated from Syracuse University Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 and State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, Magna Cum Laude, in 1959. He completed an internship, medical residency, Gastroenterology residency and GI Fellowship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and entered private practice in 1964, where he quickly began to focus his attention on the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He was the recipient of the first research award given by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Dan brought clinical trials into clinical practice. His first paper was accepted for publication in 1966. He subsequently published 329 papers. At the time of his retirement, his publications had been cited more than 15,000 times. During his 54 years at Mt. Sinai, he served as President of both the Association of the Attending Staff and the Alumni Association for which he received the coveted Jacobi Medallion for Conspicuous Service to the Alumni. Dan received every award in his field including the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award, The American Gastroenterology Association Distinguished Clinician Award, Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, The WiIIiam Dock, M.D. Master Teacher Award in Medicine State University of New York, the Janssen Award for Outstanding Achievement Award in Clinical Gastroenterology, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Arents Award for Excellence in Medicine, the highest achievement awarded by Syracuse University. He is generally recognized as having pioneered the way Crohn's disease is treated. More than any recognition, Dan loved taking care of his patients. He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Funeral services will be held on Thursday at 12pm at \"The Riverside,\" 180 West 76th St., New York. Contributions in Dan's memory may be made to the Present-Levison Fellowship at Mt. Sinai, and sent to the Division of Gastroenterology, Mt. Sinai Hospital, Box 1069, New York, New York 10029. 1/3\n",

      "MESSMORE--Mary Anne, of Baltimore, Maryland, died peacefully with her family by her side on January 11, 2016. Mary's life was most remarkable for the effect she had on the people around her. She brought light and laughter to every room she entered. A rock of comfort and support for anyone grieving or feeling lonely, Mary loved to laugh and make others laugh, play games, cook, and spend time with friends. She loved her dogs, the mountains, music, boating, reading, and traveling. But most of all, she loved her husband, John, her son, Ike, and her daughter, Lindsey. For those fortunate enough to have met her, Mary will be remembered as one of the warmest and most thoughtful people the world has known. Generous and welcoming, she opened her home to everyone-friends and strangers alike-who needed a home-cooked meal or a safe haven. She was fiercely loyal to and supportive of those close to her and kind to everyone she met. Mary's family takes comfort in the knowledge that her legacy lives on through the immeasurable impact she had on others. While the joy and laughter that her memories evoke pale in comparison to her radiant physical presence, they ensure that she will never be forgotten. It is Mary's family's hope that all who knew her will honor her memory by striving to treat others with the grace and kindness that she did. It was the size of Mary's heart that made the world a better place. A celebration of Mary's life will be held at 5pm on Saturday, January 23, at Baltimore Country Club at Five Farms, 11500 Mays Chapel Road, Lutherville, MD 21093. All friends are welcome. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary's name to Dyslexia Tutoring Program (dyslexiatutoringprogram.org). As John Irving, one of Mary's favorite authors, once wrote: \"It is hard work and great art to make life not so serious.\" In that respect, Mary was a tireless and masterful artist. 1/3\n",

      "MANUS--Morton. President of Alfred Music, passed away at his Los Angeles home on January 9 after a battle with cancer. He was a devoted husband to his wife Iris, a loving father and grandfather, an innovative music publisher, a celebrated author, an inspiring mentor to his staff, and a dedicated friend. Morty was a great man. Born in 1926 in New York to Russian immigrants Samuel and Ann, Morty proudly enlisted in the Air Force during WWII, received a business degree from The City College of New York, and in the late 1940s, joined his father in the family business, Alfred Music. When Morty started working at Alfred Music, there were four employees: Morty's father Sam, a picker, a packer, and a bookkeeper. The important part of this story is Rose, the bookkeeper, who had a daughter named Iris. Morty and Iris fell in love, and as they say, the rest is history. They were married over 60 years. Alfred Music began in New York's Tin Pan Alley in 1922 and focused on mood music for silent films. Inspired by the need for quality music education products, Morty, a pianist, clarinetist, and guitarist, reinvented the company in the 1950s. He oversaw the development of an instructional series for accordion, followed by similar publications for guitar, piano, and recorder. Morty is the author and editor of hundreds of titles in Alfred Music's catalog, including the enormously popular series, Alfred's Basic Guitar Method and Alfred's Basic Piano Library. When Alfred Music outgrew its New York headquarters in the mid-1970s, Morty and Iris moved the company to Los Angeles. As time went by, they split their time between New York and Los Angeles, having many close friends on both coasts. The company continued to grow under Morty's leadership. Morty was joined in the business by his son Ron in 1988 and his son Steven in 1992. The family business expanded into the world's leading instructional music publisher with offices in Australia, Germany, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. In 2005, Alfred Music purchased Warner Bros. Print Publications. Morty received an honorary Doctorate of Music from VanderCook College of Music in July of 2008. Morty and Iris continued to be deeply committed to music education by supporting many music scholarships, competitions, and organizations. Morty had many hobbies including being an avid sports fan, rooting for the Lakers and Dodgers. He was also a keen investor, skilled at stock charting and analysis. Among Morty's other great accomplishments was climbing Mount Washington, New Hampshire on several occasions. He would often remark to his companions during the climb, \"You will tell your grandchildren about this.\" Though terribly saddened by their loss, the Manus family members are now focusing on celebrating his life and the bright light of his legacy. Thanks to his amazing life's work, generations of music makers will continue to experience the joy of making music. Morty and Iris recently summed up their love for music education and Alfred Music with these words: \"Working a lifetime with Music and Musicians was not always milk and honey, but it was as close to heaven on earth as we could get.\" Morty is survived by his wife Iris; his three sons Steven (wife Sylvie), Scott, and Ron (partner Renee); his three granddaughters Alexandra, Samantha, and Melissandra; and his brother-in-law Jay Kopelman (wife Sherry).

      "de SIMONE--Lillian Imundo. Beloved mother, teacher and friend, passed away peacefully on January 6, 2016, after a long illness. She was at home, surrounded by her three daughters. Her charm, intelligence and wit enriched the lives of all who knew her. Born and raised in the Bronx, NY, she worked in the personnel department at the Revlon company's headquarters, and helped her brother Rico establish the New Dimension Theatre in Oradell, NJ. In the 1970's as a divorced mother of three, she entered Ramapo College, earned her bachelor's degree and then began her long, rewarding career in education. She taught drama, public speaking, English and literature at Emerson High School for 27 years, helping generations of students to find meaning in stories, to make sense of the world and to find their own voices. Beloved by her students, she was voted favorite teacher by more than a dozen senior classes. Over the years, she shared her love of travel and all things Italian with students she led on trips to Italy. She took joy in the rich process of education and was a lifelong learner herself. From the most recent archeological discovery to finding a new jazz standard; from cooking a favorite meal to alerting the family to a special moonrise, her curiosity and enthusiasm was a joy for all around her. She will be remembered for her laugh, her love of life and her fierce courage of the heart. Lillian was the youngest child of Filomena Volino Imundo and Rocco Imundo, and was predeceased by her siblings Ann, Louis, Rose and Rico. She is survived by her daughters Renata Simone of Marblehead, MA, Lauren de Simone and Stephanie Sanders of Ridgewood, NJ, and her granddaughters Lily and Roxanne Sanders. Private observances will be held. Condolences can be sent to lillydesimone@aol.com.

      "MESSMORE--Mary Anne, of Baltimore, Maryland, died peacefully with her family by her side on January 11, 2016. Mary's life was most remarkable for the effect she had on the people around her. She brought light and laughter to every room she entered. A rock of comfort and support for anyone grieving or feeling lonely, Mary loved to laugh and make others laugh, play games, cook, and spend time with friends. She loved her dogs, the mountains, music, boating, reading, and traveling. But most of all, she loved her husband, John, her son, Ike, and her daughter, Lindsey. For those fortunate enough to have met her, Mary will be remembered as one of the warmest and most thoughtful people the world has known. Generous and welcoming, she opened her home to everyone-friends and strangers alike-who needed a home-cooked meal or a safe haven. She was fiercely loyal to and supportive of those close to her and kind to everyone she met. Mary's family takes comfort in the knowledge that her legacy lives on through the immeasurable impact she had on others. While the joy and laughter that her memories evoke pale in comparison to her radiant physical presence, they ensure that she will never be forgotten. It is Mary's family's hope that all who knew her will honor her memory by striving to treat others with the grace and kindness that she did. It was the size of Mary's heart that made the world a better place. A celebration of Mary's life will be held at 5pm on Saturday, January 23, at Baltimore Country Club at Five Farms, 11500 Mays Chapel Road, Lutherville, MD 21093. All friends are welcome. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary's name to Dyslexia Tutoring Program (dyslexiatutoringprogram.org).

      "LIEBER--Constance E. March 2, 1924 - January 15, 2016. Constance Lieber transformed her family's experience with significant mental illness into a life suffused with meaning, purpose, and extraordinary effectiveness. Few people could imagine the breadth and depth of her interests, ranging from the most creative modern art to inspiring architecture, exhilarating music, and insightful studies of neuroscience and human behavior. Guided by her compassion, dedication, and curiosity - as well as her personal relationships with scores of leading psychiatrists and neuroscientists - Constance informally advised thousands of parents who were desperately seeking better treatments and cures for their mentally ill children. During their sixty-five year marriage, Constance and her husband Stephen A. Lieber shared enduring love and intense intellectual insights to transform the field of basic and clinical research into the origins of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Since 1980, Constance and Steve have been among the leading public advocates and philanthropic supporters of schizophrenia and depression research in the US and around the globe. Their efforts included the creation of significant clinical and scientific institutions to support emerging discoveries in the fields of biological psychiatry and patient services. For over twenty-five years, they gave exemplary leadership to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD), the world's largest private funder of mental health research. Constance served as President from 1989 to 2007. In 2014, their activities were honored by the American Psychiatric Association with a Special Presidential Commendation, stating \"Constance and Steve have provided unwavering moral and material support to unravel the mysteries of the brain, and to better understand and treat mental illness.\" In 1987, the Liebers established an annual award for outstanding achievements in schizophrenia research. To date, two Lieber Prize winners have gone on to win Nobel Prizes. At Columbia University, they founded two centers of excellence - the Lieber Recovery and Rehabilitation Clinic for Psychotic Disorders and the Lieber Schizophrenic Clinic. At Williams College, they were the founders of the undergraduate neuroscience program. In 2011, they created the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, affiliated with the Johns Hopkins University, to integrate new discoveries in developmental neurobiology and genetics in order to achieve clinical advances that can change lives. Constance was a graduate of Brooklyn College and attended Columbia University for her post-graduate studies. She received honorary doctorates from Williams College and Brooklyn College. She received over two dozen awards to recognize her outstanding leadership, including: the Brooke Astor Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Advancement of Science, the Women in Science Award from The Rockefeller University, the Distinguished Service Award from the Yale University's Department of Psychiatry, and the Humanitarian Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry. Survivors include her beloved husband Stephen, her children Janice and Sam (Mary Rubin), her devoted grandson, her sister Beverly, and several nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her honor to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, 90 Park Avenue, 16th Floor, New York, New York 10016. A service will be held at Larchmont Temple, 75 Larchmont Avenue, on Tuesday, January 19th at 11:30am. Burial will be private. The family will receive visitors at the family home in Mamaroneck on Wednesday and Thursday from seven to nine o'clock in the evening. At a future time, a memorial service to celebrate Connie's extraordinary life will be held in Manhattan. Please contact the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation for details. 1/3\n",

Present, born April 3, 1934, passed away on January 12th from complication of Parkinson's Disease. He was 81 years old. His passing will be deeply mourned by Jane Werner Present, his wife, partner, lover and best friend of more than 59 years, his three children, their spouses, and four grandchildren, Tracy Present, Stephanie, Michael, Billy and Katherine Podalak, Douglas, Susan, Adam and Margot Present, and his sister Judy Present Liss; his friends, associates and the thousands of lives he touched during his 50 years of practice. Dan graduated from Syracuse University Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 and State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, Magna Cum Laude, in 1959. He completed an internship, medical residency, Gastroenterology residency and GI Fellowship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and entered private practice in 1964, where he quickly began to focus his attention on the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He was the recipient of the first research award given by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Dan brought clinical trials into clinical practice. His first paper was accepted for publication in 1966. He subsequently published 329 papers. At the time of his retirement, his publications had been cited more than 15,000 times. During his 54 years at Mt. Sinai, he served as President of both the Association of the Attending Staff and the Alumni Association for which he received the coveted Jacobi Medallion for Conspicuous Service to the Alumni. Dan received every award in his field including the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award, The American Gastroenterology Association Distinguished Clinician Award, Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, The WiIIiam Dock, M.D. Master Teacher Award in Medicine State University of New York, the Janssen Award for Outstanding Achievement Award in Clinical Gastroenterology, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Arents Award for Excellence in Medicine, the highest achievement awarded by Syracuse University. He is generally recognized as having pioneered the way Crohn's disease is treated. More than any recognition, Dan loved taking care of his patients. He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Contributions in Dan's memory may be made to the Present-Levison Fellowship at Mt.

He was the most beloved husband and best friend of his wife Marion, and the much loved father of Leslie and Philip, grandfather of Laura, Stephen, Isabella and Jacqueline, father-in-law of Larry and Sue, brother of Francoise, and uncle to many French nieces and nephews. Jacques escaped from France during World War II to join the Free French Forces, and came to the United States to complete his training as a pilot.

He was the kindest and most thoughtful of men, courtly, with an insatiable curiosity about world events, and a born storyteller who drew on his adventurous youth to bring to life another era for his children and grandchildren.

The faculty and staff of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and the Maltz Research Laboratories at the Johns Hopkins Medical Campus mourn the loss of their inspirational and beloved Founder and Director, Constance Lieber. For more than 30 years, she led an international movement to bring research about behavioral brain disorders to the forefront of biomedical science. Connie Lieber's vision, her determination, and her historic generosity launched thousands of scientific careers. In 2010, she established the Lieber Institute for Brain Development because she was convinced that a new strategy was needed to accelerate progress and to find cures for developmental brain disorders. As she said: \"This is our dream, to find out what causes these disorders, and we felt it had to be a concerted effort, to study the brain and how it develops, and this is what the Institute is all about.\" The world of behavioral and developmental neuroscience has lost one of its strongest advocates and supporters. Connie is always in our hearts and minds. In honor of her passion and commitment, we will work tirelessly to achieve the mission she empowered us to pursue. 1/3\n",

      "LIEBER--Constance E. March 2, 1924 - January 15, 2016. Constance Lieber transformed her family's experience with significant mental illness into a life suffused with meaning, purpose, and extraordinary effectiveness. Few people could imagine the breadth and depth of her interests, ranging from the most creative modern art to inspiring architecture, exhilarating music, and insightful studies of neuroscience and human behavior. Guided by her compassion, dedication, and curiosity - as well as her personal relationships with scores of leading psychiatrists and neuroscientists - Constance informally advised thousands of parents who were desperately seeking better treatments and cures for their mentally ill children. During their sixty-five year marriage, Constance and her husband Stephen A. Lieber shared enduring love and intense intellectual insights to transform the field of basic and clinical research into the origins of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Since 1980, Constance and Steve have been among the leading public advocates and philanthropic supporters of schizophrenia and depression research in the US and around the globe. Their efforts included the creation of significant clinical and scientific institutions to support emerging discoveries in the fields of biological psychiatry and patient services. For over twenty-five years, they gave exemplary leadership to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD), the world's largest private funder of mental health research. Constance served as President from 1989 to 2007. In 2014, their activities were honored by the American Psychiatric Association with a Special Presidential Commendation, stating \"Constance and Steve have provided unwavering moral and material support to unravel the mysteries of the brain, and to better understand and treat mental illness.\" In 1987, the Liebers established an annual award for outstanding achievements in schizophrenia research. To date, two Lieber Prize winners have gone on to win Nobel Prizes. At Columbia University, they founded two centers of excellence - the Lieber Recovery and Rehabilitation Clinic for Psychotic Disorders and the Lieber Schizophrenic Clinic. At Williams College, they were the founders of the undergraduate neuroscience program. In 2011, they created the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, affiliated with the Johns Hopkins University, to integrate new discoveries in developmental neurobiology and genetics in order to achieve clinical advances that can change lives. Constance was a graduate of Brooklyn College and attended Columbia University for her post-graduate studies. She received honorary doctorates from Williams College and Brooklyn College. She received over two dozen awards to recognize her outstanding leadership, including: the Brooke Astor Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Advancement of Science, the Women in Science Award from The Rockefeller University, the Distinguished Service Award from the Yale University's Department of Psychiatry, and the Humanitarian Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry. Survivors include her beloved husband Stephen, her children Janice and Sam (Mary Rubin), her devoted grandson, her sister Beverly, and several nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her honor to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, 90 Park Avenue, 16th Floor, New York, New York 10016. A service will be held at Larchmont Temple, 75 Larchmont Avenue, on Tuesday, January 19th at 11:30am. Burial will be private. The family will receive visitors at the family home in Mamaroneck on Wednesday and Thursday from seven to nine o'clock in the evening. At a future time, a memorial service to celebrate Connie's extraordinary life will be held in Manhattan. Please contact the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation for details. 1/3\n",

In her role as President Emeritus, she continued to offer her vision and guidance to the Foundation on a regular basis. Connie, along with her husband Stephen, passionately believed in the need to seed the field of neuropsychiatric research with as many talented scientists as possible to make a substantive impact on the broad spectrum of mental health research, which she fervently understood holds our best hope for ending the immense suffering caused by mental illness. Since 1980, Connie and Steve have served as extraordinary philanthropic supporters and leading public advocates of schizophrenia and depression research. Connie worked tirelessly for the cause and grew our grants program to a total of $342 million and was helpful to so many families who were desperately seeking help for their children.

As the owner of a manufacturing business, he had clients throughout the City and watched neighborhoods change. He remembered horse drawn carriages filled the street and veterans of the Civil War parading in their uniforms on Memorial Day. His father survived the 1918 influenza and his uncle was gassed in World War I. Dad received an excellent public school education and graduated with highest honors from his high school while working for the Brooklyn Eagle covering sports. He entered Columbia in 1928 but to his great regret, had to leave to contribute to the support of his family. He made up for this perceived shortcoming by visiting libraries and museums. He became a connoisseur of drawings and paintings with a small collection. His deep commitment to the City was expressed in community service. Our father was the longest serving trustee of Congregation Emanu-El; he chaired many of its committees and he and our mother endowed its museum of Judaica. They were both actively involved in a number of charitable organizations. For Dad it included Montefiore Medical Center and UJA-Federation. He also was particularly proud of his service to his industry. For many years he was a board member of the Paperboard Packaging Council and served a term as its non-executive President. In addition to us he is survived by grandchildren, Geoffrey Dann, Deborah Fields, Adam Bernard and Claire Bernard, and great-grandchildren, Rebecca Dann, Emily Dann, and Lion Bernard De Rham.

As the owner of a manufacturing business, he had clients throughout the City and watched neighborhoods change. He remembered horse drawn carriages filled the street and veterans of the Civil War parading in their uniforms on Memorial Day. His father survived the 1918 influenza and his uncle was gassed in World War I. Dad received an excellent public school education and graduated with highest honors from his high school while working for the Brooklyn Eagle covering sports. He entered Columbia in 1928 but to his great regret, had to leave to contribute to the support of his family. He made up for this perceived shortcoming by visiting libraries and museums. He became a connoisseur of drawings and paintings with a small collection. His deep commitment to the City was expressed in community service. Our father was the longest serving trustee of Congregation Emanu-El; he chaired many of its committees and he and our mother endowed its museum of Judaica. They were both actively involved in a number of charitable organizations. For Dad it included Montefiore Medical Center and UJA-Federation. He also was particularly proud of his service to his industry. For many years he was a board member of the Paperboard Packaging Council and served a term as its non-executive President. In addition to us he is survived by grandchildren, Geoffrey Dann, Deborah Fields, Adam Bernard and Claire Bernard, and great-grandchildren, Rebecca Dann, Emily Dann, and Lion Bernard De Rham. There will be a private family funeral service. Contributions in his honor may be made to the Herbert and Eileen Bernard Museum Judaica Fund at Congregation Emanu-El.

      "GARIBALDI--Justice Marie L.,of Weehawken, NJ, passed on January 15, 2016. Justice Garibaldi was born November 26, 1934, in Jersey City to Dr. Louis and Marie S. Garibaldi. As an only child, she lived most of her life in Hudson County. The Garibaldis raised their daughter with a strong belief in equal opportunity for women and encouraged her to pursue a nontraditional career path. She was a pioneer and role model to so many. She is survived by loving cousins, adoring godchildren and many cherished friends and colleagues. As a child, Justice Garibaldi attended Stevens Hoboken Academy through 12th grade. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in economics and a political science minor from Connecticut College (New London, CT) in 1956. With an intent to follow in her grandfather's footsteps and attend business school, Justice Garibaldi learned first-hand women weren't accepted. Instead, she enrolled in Columbia Law School as a pathway into the business world and graduated in 1959. In 1963, Justice Garibaldi earned her Master of Laws degree in tax law from New York University School of Law. She was a member of the New Jersey, New York, and District of Columbia Bars and the first woman to serve as president of the New Jersey State Bar Association. Justice Garibaldi began her legal career with the New York Regional Counsel in the Internal Revenue Service. She received extensive trial experience in Tax Court. The Hatch Act restricted government employees from political speech-making and article-writing which ultimately caused Justice Garibaldi to make her next career move. She briefly worked at a firm now known as Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti (Riker, Danzig)-within three years she was made a partner which was virtually unheard of at that time. While at Riker, Danzig, Justice Garibaldi also served as a municipal court judge in Weehawken, NJ, from 1973 to 1975, writing the majority of opinion in several cases affecting women. Justice Garibaldi was introduced to Republican Thomas H. Kean by a Riker, Danzig partner. This ultimately led Justice Garibaldi to serve as co-chair of his gubernatorial campaign. Once elected, Governor Thomas H. Kean nominated Justice Garibaldi to the New Jersey Supreme Court. In 1982, Justice Garibaldi became the first woman appointed to the New Jersey Supreme Court- she served as Associate Justice of New Jersey's highest court until she retired in 2000. She authored more than 225 opinions while on the Supreme Court and was known for her advocacy of complementary dispute resolution. She chaired the Supreme Court's committee on that subject, and in 1998, the American Inns of Court Foundation established the Justice Marie L. Garibaldi American Inn of Court for Alternative Dispute Resolution. Justice Garibaldi was the recipient of many awards, including the Medal of Excellence from the Columbia University School of Law. She received honorary degrees from St. John's University Law School, Seton Hall University Law School, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Drew University, Upsala College, St. Peter's College, Caldwell College, and the College of Saint Elizabeth. Justice Garibaldi joined the Hackensack University Medical Center in 2001 and served as vice chair of Hackensack University Medical Center's Board of Governors. She also served on the Hackensack University Health Network's Board of Trustees, as chair of the Executive Compensation Committee and on the Hackensack University Medical Center Foundation's Board of Trustees. She chaired the Hudson Riverfront Performing Arts Center and served as a member of the Board of Directors of the National Italian American Foundation. Justice Garibaldi also served as a director of Crown Holdings, Inc. from 2000 to 2007. She also served as a member of the New Jersey Council on Local Mandates. In addition, Justice Garibaldi served as the secretary of the American Association Order of Malta, USA and executive vice president of the American Society of the Italian Legions of Merit. She also served as a director of the State Chamber of Commerce, New Jersey Bell Telephone Co., and the Washington Savings Bank. She also was a trustee of St. Peter's College. Justice Garibaldi truly enjoyed traveling, reading mysteries, and dinner and dancing with friends. She will be greatly missed by friends, loved ones and colleagues. Justice Marie L. Garibaldi was predeceased by her parents-her father, Dr. Louis Garibaldi passed away in 1975 and her mother, Marie S. Garibaldi passed away in 2013 at the age of 103. The funeral will be on Thursday, January 21 at 9am from the Leber Funeral Home in Union City then to St. Augustine Church where, at 10am, a Mass will be offered. Visitation will be on Tuesday, January 19 from 7 to 9pm, Wednesday, January 20 from 2 to 5pm and 7 to 9pm. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Hackensack University Medical Center Foundation, Hackensack, NJ; St. Augustine's School, Union City, NJ; Hudson Riverfront Performing Arts Center, Weehawken, NJ. 1/3\n",

For more than 30 years, she led an international movement to bring research about behavioral brain disorders to the forefront of biomedical science. Connie Lieber's vision, her determination, and her historic generosity launched thousands of scientific careers. In 2010, she established the Lieber Institute for Brain Development because she was convinced that a new strategy was needed to accelerate progress and to find cures for developmental brain disorders. As she said: \"This is our dream, to find out what causes these disorders, and we felt it had to be a concerted effort, to study the brain and how it develops, and this is what the Institute is all about.\" The world of behavioral and developmental neuroscience has lost one of its strongest advocates and supporters.

      "ADES--Alan M. (1925-2016). Manhattan School of Music and its Board of Trustees are profoundly saddened by the passing of Alan M. Ades, a successful entrepreneur and deeply committed philanthropist who was a great friend to MSM and an influential force for progress at the School. A Trustee Emeritus who served as a member of the School's Board of Trustees for 21 years between 1990 and 2011, Mr. Ades, along with his wife Joan Taub Ades, made many profound contributions to MSM over the years, ensuring the School's advancement as one of the world's leading independent music conservatories. In addition to his important service as a member of MSM's Board, Mr. Ades' stewardship was reflected in his active commitment to the many MSM committees of which he was a member and by the generous leadership contributions he and Mrs. Ades made to the School, often by way of the Joan and Alan Ades-Taub Family Foundation. Many of Mr. Ades' most significant contributions to MSM were guided by his love of opera (he also served as a director at the Met Opera and Santa Fe Opera). In addition to providing generous support to MSM scholarships for classical vocalists, the Ades Family Foundation established and continues to fund the School's prestigious Alan M. and Joan Taub Ades Vocal Competition, an annual event that is judged by an esteemed panel of opera professionals and awards significant cash prizes to winning students. Perhaps most significant, Mr. and Mrs. Ades led the capital campaign for, and ultimately named, one of MSM's key performance and rehearsal spaces, an indispensable, flexible black-box space that not only accommodates full-scale opera and orchestral rehearsals, but also seats audiences of up to 200 for a wide variety of performances. This key addition to MSM's facility-the Alan M. and Joan Taub Ades Performance Space-opened its doors in 2007 and stands as a lively testament to the visionary leadership and generosity made to MSM by this prominent leader in business and philanthropy and his wife, Joan Taub Ades. Our Board of Trustees, Administration, Faculty, Alumni, and Current Students are united in expressing the MSM Community's sorrow at the passing of this singular individual. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Ades, whose continuing friendship we so highly cherish, and to the Ades family; we know that Alan's long, rich, accomplished life and the many wonderful memories it inspires will be a source of comfort and joy in the days and years ahead.

      "LIEBER--Constance E. The Brain & Behavior Research Foundation, formerly the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD), deeply mourns the passing of its visionary leader and President Emeritus, Constance E. Lieber. Connie, who served as President of the Foundation from 1989 to 2007, felt that research was the best avenue to find meaningful and lasting solutions to alleviate the suffering caused by mental illness. In her role as President Emeritus, she continued to offer her vision and guidance to the Foundation on a regular basis. Connie, along with her husband Stephen, passionately believed in the need to seed the field of neuropsychiatric research with as many talented scientists as possible to make a substantive impact on the broad spectrum of mental health research, which she fervently understood holds our best hope for ending the immense suffering caused by mental illness. Since 1980, Connie and Steve have served as extraordinary philanthropic supporters and leading public advocates of schizophrenia and depression research. Connie worked tirelessly for the cause and grew our grants program to a total of $342 million and was helpful to so many families who were desperately seeking help for their children. We recognize that she enhanced the lives of so many through her work for Brain & Behavior Research Foundation and by supporting scientists throughout the world and have the deepest gratitude to both Connie and Steve. Their generosity in supporting research on mental illness is a great model for all of us. Our deepest sympathies to Connie's beloved husband Steve, their daughter Janice, their son Sam and daughter-in-law Mary, their grandson, and to all of their loved ones. Connie was our leader and guiding light, providing inspiration and motivation to all who ever had the honor and privilege of knowing and working with her.

Kennedy and Deputy Assistant of the Treasury and Director of Law Enforcement under Secretaries of the Treasury David Kennedy, John Connally and George Schultz. He helped develop civil rights legislation and developed and coordinated law enforcement policy within the Treasury Department, including the IRS, Customs, Secret Service and Interpol.

      "DAYTON--Robert. Robert Dayton, whose career spanned decades in support of a vibrant downtown Minneapolis, MN, died on January 17th. He was 73 years old. A great-grandson of the founder of Daytons, Bob carried on the family retail and community-oriented legacy. After graduating from Yale in 1964, Bob joined what was to become Dayton Hudson and then Target, rising to become General Merchandise Manager and then Vice President of Stores. While with Daytons, Bob attended the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School. A merchandiser at heart, Bob became recognized for his deftness in identifying and supporting designers such as Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren early in their careers. In 1977 Bob left Daytons and purchased Harold, an upscale specialty store for women. Working together with his wife Joanie, Bob restored its iconic status as a Minneapolis retail institution. In 1984 Bob spearheaded the development of The Conservatory, the first enclosed shopping complex in Minneapolis. Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma. In 1992 Bob became CEO of Okabena, helping transform the Dayton family office into a nationally recognized leader in the then-nascent family office industry. Fiercely loyal to and enormously proud of the people and places he loved, Bob was committed to serving his community. He worked tirelessly on behalf of many non-profits including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, the United Way, and Westminster Presbyterian Church. In addition, Bob served as a Trustee of the Blake School, Carlton College, and the University of Minnesota Foundation. In 1994 Bob founded and was later named Chair Emeritus of the Mentoring Partnership of Minnesota. Bob grew up in Wayzata, Minnesota and attended Blake, Eaglebrook, and Taft. While at Yale, Bob met his wife Joanie, then attending Skidmore College, on a blind date at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. They were married in 1964 and had three boys. Bob enjoyed a number of hobbies, but none more so than golf. Beginning at Woodhill Country Club, his passion eventually extended east to Pine Valley and west to Cypress Point. He cofounded Spring Hill Golf Club and enjoyed playing in the U.S. Seniors. Bob will always be remembered for his warm heart, wonderful smile, infectious laughter, fantastic sense of humor, and tremendous spirit. He is survived by Joanie, his wife of 51 years, two brothers, three sons, and seven grandchildren.

      "ZIELENZIGER--Dr. Ruth, who helped change how Conservative Jews in America are taught the Bible, and inspired some of Israel's most enduring poetry of love while a young woman, died Thursday at the RiverWalk independent living facility of the Hebrew Home in the Bronx, one day shy of her 93rd birthday. Awarded her Doctorate of Hebrew Literature at age 66, Dr. Zielenziger was instrumental in creating the curriculum for teaching the books of Genesis and Exodus in Conservative Judaism at the Melton Research Center of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. The Melton program emphasized critical inquiry and the study of Bible for character education. She was a proponent of studying the creation myths and texts of other Middle Eastern cultures in order to better understand the context in which the Bible was written. Born in London, the daughter of Leo and Lola Herrmann, ardent Zionists, she grew up in Jerusalem before the founding of the Jewish state, and served as an ambulance driver and chauffeur in the British Army during World War II, where her fluency in Hebrew, English and German was invaluable. After the War, she attended the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where she met a German emigre and fellow student, Yehuda Pfeuffer, whom she renamed Yehuda Amichai. Amichai went on to become Israel's most celebrated poet, and the first drafts of many of his most enduring poems were composed as letters exchanged between the two. Amichai's letters to Dr. Zielenziger are now archived at Ben Gurion University in Israel. She moved to New York in 1947, to study at the Teachers Institute of the Seminary. While in New York she met and subsequently married Eric W. Zielenziger, a German Jewish survivor of the Holocaust who escaped the Nazis by living underground in Amsterdam for more than two years. They had two children. For 34 years, Dr. Zielenziger taught education at the Jewish Theological Seminary, after teaching for many years in Hebrew schools in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Before relocating to Riverdale in their later years the Zielenzigers lived primarily in Freeport and Great Neck, NY. She is survived by her sons David, of Great Neck, and Michael (Diane Abt) of Oakland, CA and Manhattan and a brother, Dr. Gabriel Herrmann of Jerusalem. Services will be held Friday at 11am at Riverside Nassau North, 55 N. Station Plaza, Great Neck, NY. 1/3\n",

      "DAYTON--Robert. Robert Dayton, whose career spanned decades in support of a vibrant downtown Minneapolis, MN, died on January 17th. He was 73 years old. A great-grandson of the founder of Daytons, Bob carried on the family retail and community-oriented legacy. After graduating from Yale in 1964, Bob joined what was to become Dayton Hudson and then Target, rising to become General Merchandise Manager and then Vice President of Stores. While with Daytons, Bob attended the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School. A merchandiser at heart, Bob became recognized for his deftness in identifying and supporting designers such as Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren early in their careers. In 1977 Bob left Daytons and purchased Harold, an upscale specialty store for women. Working together with his wife Joanie, Bob restored its iconic status as a Minneapolis retail institution. In 1984 Bob spearheaded the development of The Conservatory, the first enclosed shopping complex in Minneapolis. Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma. In 1992 Bob became CEO of Okabena, helping transform the Dayton family office into a nationally recognized leader in the then-nascent family office industry. Fiercely loyal to and enormously proud of the people and places he loved, Bob was committed to serving his community. He worked tirelessly on behalf of many non-profits including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, the United Way, and Westminster Presbyterian Church. In addition, Bob served as a Trustee of the Blake School, Carlton College, and the University of Minnesota Foundation. In 1994 Bob founded and was later named Chair Emeritus of the Mentoring Partnership of Minnesota. Bob grew up in Wayzata, Minnesota and attended Blake, Eaglebrook, and Taft. While at Yale, Bob met his wife Joanie, then attending Skidmore College, on a blind date at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. They were married in 1964 and had three boys. Bob enjoyed a number of hobbies, but none more so than golf. Beginning at Woodhill Country Club, his passion eventually extended east to Pine Valley and west to Cypress Point. He cofounded Spring Hill Golf Club and enjoyed playing in the U.S. Seniors. Bob will always be remembered for his warm heart, wonderful smile, infectious laughter, fantastic sense of humor, and tremendous spirit. He is survived by Joanie, his wife of 51 years, two brothers, three sons, and seven grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on February 18th at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis. 1/3\n",

Jack was born in New York City, December 24, 1945, later preferring to tell folks he grew up on a small island off the coast of New Jersey. He studied at Stephens Institute of Technology and later earned his BS degree at Long Island University. Taking pre-med courses, he planned to follow in the footsteps of his deceased father, who was a NYC physician. All that changed when he took a summer job at Thomas J. Lipton company where he discovered the many faceted world of food science. His enthusiasm for food science never diminished. During his 20 year corporate career, he worked at a number of leading food companies including Best Food and Chesebrough Ponds. He gained experienced in every aspect of food processing, plant production, food safety, product development and federal filing regulations and practices. He was a trained taster who could recognize the individual spices in any combination presented, much to the surprise of restaurant chefs, a number of whom he advised and befriended over the years. As his career evolved, his focus centered on canned foods and he became one of New York's foremost food processing authorities. As such, he was a consultant who was recognized and worked with the United States Department of Agriculture and food processing. An avid sailor and scuba diver since his teens, Jack left the corporate world behind to sail from New York City to the Caribbean with a sailor buddy, exploring practically every island there during their six month cruise. Soon after his return, he formed his own company, Van Ness Food Technologies, which he operated while living aboard his 37 foot sailboat, \"Cruzin,\" docked at City Island, NY. In 1992, he found \"the love he had been waiting for\" when he met Carolyn, another enthusiastic scuba diver. They married in 2001 aboard a yacht in New York harbor. Throughout their years together, they traveled the world, lured by possible dive adventures in the Caribbean, Bora Bora, Europe, Mexico and the Red Sea. One of Jack's favorite sea stories was about his transatlantic sail aboard a 42 foot sailboat from Bermuda to Malaga, Spain. \"Sailing across the Pond is on every sailor's bucket list and I couldn't be happier or more satisfied because I got to do it,\" said Jack. Jack loved being with friends and sharing sea stories based on his experiences sailing with Carolyn up and down Long Island Sound, always on the lookout for a new raft up spot and seafood restaurant. For almost 30 years, Jack's consulting business worked with international clients in Canada, Greece, Israel and Korea. He was a featured lecturer at the First Food Safety Conference held in Bangalore, India, where he taught Indian food scientists how to implement Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point safety principles. Jack was a hands on expert who knew how to build and manage a food plant from its conception to the time the canned food product was on the pallet ready to go to market. He was known for his strong sense of integrity and absolute dedication to ensuring the safety of any food product under his production management. He was a charter member of IFTPS, participating in annual food conferences in the US and abroad. Jack was more than generous in passing along his wealth of knowledge to his many clients, interspersed with updates about his latest sailing or diving adventures. His genuine enjoyment of life was contagious. It enabled Jack to engage in lively conversations and make friends with young and old alike. With the wind at his back, he has charted his course, leaving us with memories of an unforgettable personality, sharp wit, brilliant mind and smile. Besides his beloved wife, Carolyn, he leaves behind a worldwide group of business associates and longtime friends, whose many lives he touched. At his request, his ashes are to be scattered over the area waters that gave him so much pleasure. There will be a celebration of Jack's life during the coming sailing season. 1/3\n",

      "WASHINGTON--Bryan R.,professor of late 19th and 20th century American literature and cultural studies, and a man of considerable wit, humor, style, elegance, and charm, with a passion for the beauty and joy of some of life's most abundant and finest offerings, died of cancer on December 31, 2015. He was 57. The son of Dr. Joseph R. Washington, Jr. and the late Sophia M. Washington, Bryan was born in Boston, Massachusetts. During his formative years, Bryan lived in numerous towns and cities in Wisconsin, Virginia, California, and Pennsylvania, where he attended the University of Pennsylvania. At UPenn, Bryan was a Benjamin Franklin Scholar; he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree (with honors) in General Literature in 1980. UPenn served as a catalyst for Bryan's graduate studies, which led him to complete his Master's Degree in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford University in 1982 through Penn's Thouron Award, a British-American exchange program. Bryan received his second Master's Degree in English and American Language at Harvard University in 1985. He was also a Minority Prize Fellow from 1982-1987. Bryan received his Ph.D. in English and American Literature and Language from Harvard in 1989. Bryan launched his academic career as an instructor at Lafayette College in 1987 and was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1989. He served as a Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University from 1991-1992. In 1994, Bryan was promoted to Associate Professor with full tenure. Bryan's scholarly work includes the publication of a book entitled \"The Politics of Exile: The Ideology in Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and James Baldwin\" in 1995. The book was well received and widely cited. It is considered by many to be one of the first works to position James Baldwin alongside white canonical American authors. Bryan also authored several articles and reviews, including: \"Paris Blues(s),\" an essay on James Baldwin; and \"WASP Mischief: Martha Stewart and the Racial Status Quo.\" He was in the process of writing two books before he became ill. Throughout his career at Lafayette, which spanned over a quarter century, Bryan received numerous honors, including the Student Government Superior Teaching Award in 1989-1990 and 1992-1993, which is rare for a professor to receive twice. Bryan delivered presentations at Lafayette on topics such as \"Blacks in Popular Culture\" and \"Black Writers in the Classroom.\" In May 2014, Bryan delivered \"The Last Lecture\" to graduating seniors; this was, sadly, Bryan's last lecture and last professional engagement. The title of the lecture was: \"In the Course of It All: Life is Words;\" this honor, along with the two student government teaching awards, suggests how deeply he was loved by his students- his courses were always over-enrolled. Students described him as inspiring, exciting, funny, and extremely smart. Bryan once described his teaching in the following terms: \"If asked what I aim to accomplish in the classroom, I would say I am trying for a good conversation. For in all my courses dialogue is a primary emphasis. I enjoy lecturing, but my class presentations, generally, are designed to provoke dissuasion. Whether just beginning college work or about to finish, undergraduates (I believe) have something to teach me.\" As a resident of Doylestown, PA, Bryan's life included jazz and the American songbook as a joy, metaphor and interpretation of his many passions: writing, literary criticism, food, art, \"beautiful things,\" and, of course, Paris. During evenings, he would often play his stereo or the piano and sing to Carmen McRae, Shirley Horn or other great jazz artists, while duck was in the oven (or some other scrumptious dish) along with a plate of pate and wine at the ready, all for the evening's feast to be shared with Russell Clinton, his husband and life partner for 23 years, and, on many occasions, close friends. During his stay fighting cancer in various hospitals and healthcare facilities, Bryan often said that the rooms that he was in were \"simply awful\", and \"he wants to go out in style\" - of course his care and room assignments were, in fact, top notch! But, we all know Bryan and his desire to be surrounded by beauty. So, what did he do to dress up his room(s)? He buys a beautifully designed Simon Pearce lamp for only a brief stay. And, at Christmas, even though he was unable to eat solid foods or drink, he had a bounty of epicurean delights delivered from Dean and Deluca for him to taste and smell, including his favorite wines and brandy, all for the decadence of it all, and to celebrate his favorite holiday in abundance with his dear Russell. In addition to his husband Russell, Bryan is survived by his father, Joseph; father and mother-in-law, Bill and Ruthann; brother, David, and his partner, Christine; Russell's sister, Debbie and her children Calvin, Travis and Kiara and numerous other family members and friends. A celebration of Bryan's life will be held at 4pm, Friday, January 29, 2016 at Buckingham Friends School, 5684 York Road, Lahaska, PA. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania Annual Fund, Penn Medicine Development, 3535 Market Street, Suite 750, Philadelphia, PA 19104 or online at https://www.cancer. pennmedicine.org.

      "DAYTON--Robert. Robert Dayton, whose career spanned decades in support of a vibrant downtown Minneapolis, MN, died on January 17th. He was 73 years old. A great-grandson of the founder of Daytons, Bob carried on the family retail and community-oriented legacy. After graduating from Yale in 1964, Bob joined what was to become Dayton Hudson and then Target, rising to become General Merchandise Manager and then Vice President of Stores. While with Daytons, Bob attended the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School. A merchandiser at heart, Bob became recognized for his deftness in identifying and supporting designers such as Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren early in their careers. In 1977 Bob left Daytons and purchased Harold, an upscale specialty store for women. Working together with his wife Joanie, Bob restored its iconic status as a Minneapolis retail institution. In 1984 Bob spearheaded the development of The Conservatory, the first enclosed shopping complex in Minneapolis. Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma. In 1992 Bob became CEO of Okabena, helping transform the Dayton family office into a nationally recognized leader in the then-nascent family office industry. Fiercely loyal to and enormously proud of the people and places he loved, Bob was committed to serving his community. He worked tirelessly on behalf of many non-profits including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, the United Way, and Westminster Presbyterian Church. In addition, Bob served as a Trustee of the Blake School, Carlton College, and the University of Minnesota Foundation. In 1994 Bob founded and was later named Chair Emeritus of the Mentoring Partnership of Minnesota. Bob grew up in Wayzata, Minnesota and attended Blake, Eaglebrook, and Taft. While at Yale, Bob met his wife Joanie, then attending Skidmore College, on a blind date at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. They were married in 1964 and had three boys. Bob enjoyed a number of hobbies, but none more so than golf. Beginning at Woodhill Country Club, his passion eventually extended east to Pine Valley and west to Cypress Point. He cofounded Spring Hill Golf Club and enjoyed playing in the U.S. Seniors. Bob will always be remembered for his warm heart, wonderful smile, infectious laughter, fantastic sense of humor, and tremendous spirit. He is survived by Joanie, his wife of 51 years, two brothers, three sons, and seven grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on February 18th at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis. 1/3\n",

George Weidenfeld grew up in Vienna and fled Austria after the Nazi takeover in 1938. Because he was saved by a Christian family, George never forgot that his life was spared by Christians and just last year, he created a foundation to rescue thousands of persecuted Christians in the Middle East. This man never forgot his debts and always repaid them. As an immigrant during World War II, George became an integral part of the BBC World Service and broadcast reports in several languages. In 1969, Queen Elizabeth acknowledged Britain's appreciation and knighted him, followed by a life peerage in the House of Lords in 1976. Last April, at the age of 95, Lord Weidenfeld was awarded the WJC's Theodor Herzl Award in London and became an honorary vice-president of the World Jewish Congress. There are few people in the entire world who have spoken out with more courage against injustice. Our dear friend George was one.

      "ZIELENZIGER--Dr. Ruth, who helped change how Conservative Jews in America are taught the Bible, and inspired some of Israel's most enduring poetry of love while a young woman, died Thursday at the RiverWalk independent living facility of the Hebrew Home in the Bronx, one day shy of her 93rd birthday. Awarded her Doctorate of Hebrew Literature at age 66, Dr. Zielenziger was instrumental in creating the curriculum for teaching the books of Genesis and Exodus in Conservative Judaism at the Melton Research Center of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. The Melton program emphasized critical inquiry and the study of Bible for character education. She was a proponent of studying the creation myths and texts of other Middle Eastern cultures in order to better understand the context in which the Bible was written. Born in London, the daughter of Leo and Lola Herrmann, ardent Zionists, she grew up in Jerusalem before the founding of the Jewish state, and served as an ambulance driver and chauffeur in the British Army during World War II, where her fluency in Hebrew, English and German was invaluable. After the War, she attended the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where she met a German emigre and fellow student, Yehuda Pfeuffer, whom she renamed Yehuda Amichai. Amichai went on to become Israel's most celebrated poet, and the first drafts of many of his most enduring poems were composed as letters exchanged between the two. Amichai's letters to Dr. Zielenziger are now archived at Ben Gurion University in Israel. She moved to New York in 1947, to study at the Teachers Institute of the Seminary. While in New York she met and subsequently married Eric W. Zielenziger, a German Jewish survivor of the Holocaust who escaped the Nazis by living underground in Amsterdam for more than two years. They had two children. For 34 years, Dr. Zielenziger taught education at the Jewish Theological Seminary, after teaching for many years in Hebrew schools in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Before relocating to Riverdale in their later years the Zielenzigers lived primarily in Freeport and Great Neck, NY. She is survived by her sons David, of Great Neck, and Michael (Diane Abt) of Oakland, CA and Manhattan and a brother, Dr. Gabriel Herrmann of Jerusalem. 1/3\n",

After earning a Master of Architecture degree from Yale University, Fredenburgh worked for a quarter century at I.M. Pei & Partners, where he was an associate partner and design principal. He established his own office, Fredenburgh Wegierska-Mutin Architects, in 1990. In his work with the Pei firm and in independent practice, each of his buildings marked its setting with iconic forms and distinctive public spaces, from a master planned waterfront promenade in Dubai to the iconic CenTrust Tower in Miami, Texas Commerce Tower in Houston, and First Interstate World Center, the tallest building west of Chicago, which provides a memorable centerpoint to the vast horizontal landscape of Los Angeles. Harold Fredenburgh also made major contributions to the design of the John Hancock Tower in Boston. Fredenburgh's efforts in landmark preservation and planning policy contributed to shaping New York City. For two decades his leadership in planning and design review in his home community of Bronxville, New York, was instrumental in preserving the unique character of a landmark residential village while allowing it to meet the challenges of contemporary needs. He was a guiding voice on the Scholarship and Brunner Award Committees of the American Institute of Architects/New York Chapter, a member of the Planning and Urban Design Committee, and a founding member of the Society of Architectural Historians. An unusually well read and scholarly architect, he was an accomplished international lecturer on design and urban planning issues, and was widely regarded in both the university and in the office as a dedicated teacher and ardent advocate of young professionals. As a consequence of his experience with the design of tall buildings, in 1998 he was elected one of four American members of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Building Sciences. He was elevated to Fellowship in the American Institute of Architects in 2014. Harold Fredenburgh will be very missed by his daughter Audrey Mateer, son-in-law Robert Williams, Anna Mutin, friends and colleagues. 1/3\n",

      "KENNEDY--Michael John, on January 25, 2016 at age 78 of cancer. Civil rights lawyer who fought for the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Mr. Kennedy, whose career as both a civil liberties and criminal attorney began in California in the 1960s, successfully defended Black Panther Huey Newton on manslaughter and murder charges in Oakland. In San Francisco, he won acquittal for all seven young Mexican Americans, Los Siete de la Raza, charged with murdering a police officer in the city's Mission District. And when Jimmy Mitchell, co-owner of San Francisco's notorious O'Farrell Theatre-which journalist Hunter S. Thompson called 'The Carnegie Hall of Public Sex'-was accused of killing his brother Artie in a drunken rage, Mr. Kennedy succeeded in having the charge reduced from murder in the second degree to manslaughter. In Illinois he represented Rennie Davis, a member of the Chicago Eight accused of conspiracy and inciting a riot during the 1968 Democratic National Convention and served as Mr. Davis's lawyer before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C. He also represented Bernardine Dohrn who belonged to 1960s radical group, The Weathermen. Other of his clients belonged to the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the most famous member of which was Timothy Leary, LSD guru to a generation. In Lincoln, Nebraska, Mr. Kennedy won acquittal for a Penobscot Native American charged with assaulting FBI agents at Wounded Knee. Perhaps his most famous trial and certainly the most time consuming-it still remains the longest criminal jury trial in U.S. Federal Court history-was The Pizza Connection; the name came from accusations of drug money laundering through pizza parlors in New York City. When the U.S. Attorney put two warring mafia families on trial, the case played out like a drama between the Capulets and the Montagues with Mr. Kennedy retained as chief council representing one of the godfathers, Sicilian mob boss Gaetano Badalamenti. Wire taps were the basis for charges against six Americans raising money in New York to buy weapons for the IRA in Ireland. As lead council, Mr. Kennedy won an acquittal for all six men. He also won clemency from New York Governor Mario Cuomo for Jean Harris, the private girls' school headmistress who was in prison for the notorious murder of her lover, Scarsdale Diet doctor Herman Tarnower. Mr. Kennedy worked on only one divorce case in his career and although the settlement was sealed, reliable sources reported that Ivana Trump was very pleased. There were many pro-bono cases about which no one has written. And there were many times when people from all walks of life, the high, the low, and the undocumented, sought Kennedy's advice privately and many times he privately reached out to connections, sometimes in the government, sometimes in the underworld. As general council to High Times Magazine for 41 years, Mr. Kennedy and his friend, the magazine's founder, the late Tom Forcade, sought to subvert prohibition of marijuana. When a reporter recently asked Mr. Kennedy how he kept High Times out of trouble for so long, he replied simply that he had never asked or allowed them to do anything illegal but added: \"At High Times we will never forget what was done in the name of law enforcement to our scarred arrestees, and those who still rot in prison for daring to try to enjoy themselves peacefully and harmlessly.\" Mr. Kennedy was the consummate gentleman, with a quick Irish wit and a quick Irish temper. But he very rarely raised his voice, being the personification of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy: Speak softly but carry a big stick. The romance between Michael Kennedy and Eleanora, his wife of forty-seven years, is the stuff of fairy tales. Marrying after love at first sight, they never spent a night apart and sometimes signed their names as one word. Although not an attorney, Mrs. Kennedy was her husband's most trusted associate and confidant working entirely behind the scenes on every case, becoming an unofficial voir dire expert. The couple eschewed the label 'socialite' but could be seen often at benefits for Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, the Central Park Conservancy and the United Nations. They gave as many parties as they attended, a number of which were chronicled in New York Magazine and the New York Social Diary. When not working or traveling, Mr. Kennedy spent his time between New York City, his Hamptons home Kilkare, his old Key West cottage in West Palm Beach and his house in Ireland's Black Valley. Michael John Kennedy, who died at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, was born in the state of Washington in 1937. After boarding school in Washington, he attended University of California at Berkeley and Hastings Law School. Besides his wife Eleanora, he leaves his daughters Anna Safir and Lisa Kennedy, his son Scott Hamilton Kennedy, three granddaughters and two grandsons. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Wednesday from 2-4 and 6-8pm. The funeral service will be held on Thursday at 10am at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle, 60th Street and Columbus Avenue. 1/3\n",

      "WALRATH--Dale Robert, of Manhattan, NY and formerly Wilton, CT, died on December 31, 2015 at home, at the age of 94. He was a World War II veteran, Mad Man, and devoted husband and father, who succumbed to Alzheimer's after a 12-year dignified struggle. An exemplar of the Greatest Generation, he was raised on a farm in Ohio, graduated from Ohio Wesleyan on scholarship, enlisted in the Army in 1943, and fought on the Western Front throughout Germany, receiving the Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart before his honorable discharge in 1945. He moved to Connecticut in 1956, embarking on a 33-year career on the creative side with J. Walter Thompson in Manhattan. During his tenure at Thompson he helped develop the \"Built Ford Tough\" campaign and pioneered broadcast shoots in California. He was the most selfless of men, active in the community post-retirement, while caring for an ailing spouse for years. Survivors include his son Christopher Bret and daughter Rosalind Anne, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren, Margot, Victoria and Amanda. His courage, dignity, sacrifice for others, vitality, kindness, and extraordinary decency are treasured by all who knew him. 1/3\n",

He was the author of The Golden Age of Opera and, at the time of his death, was at work on a biography of soprano Kirsten Flagstad.

      "KENNEDY--Michael John. On January 25, 2016 at age 78 of cancer. Civil rights lawyer who fought for the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Mr. Kennedy, whose career as both a civil liberties and criminal attorney began in California in the 1960s and culminated in 2009 as Special Advisor to the President of the United Nations, Miguel D'Escoto. He successfully defended Black Panther Huey Newton on manslaughter and murder charges in Oakland. In San Francisco, he won acquittal for all seven young Mexican Americans, Los Siete de la Raza, charged with murdering a police officer in the city's Mission District. And when Jimmy Mitchell, co- owner of San Francisco's notorious O'Farrell Theatre- which journalist Hunter S. Thompson called 'The Carnegie Hall of Public Sex'-was accused of killing his brother Artie in a drunken rage, Mr. Kennedy succeeded in having the charge reduced from murder in the second degree to manslaughter. In Illinois he represented Rennie Davis, a member of the Chicago Eight accused of conspiracy and inciting a riot during the 1968 Democratic National Convention and served as Mr. Davis's lawyer before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C. He also represented Bernardine Dohrn who belonged to 1960s radical group, The Weathermen. Other of his clients belonged to the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the most famous member of which was Timothy Leary, LSD guru to a generation. In Lincoln, Nebraska, Mr. Kennedy won acquittal for a Penobscot Native American charged with assaulting FBI agents at Wounded Knee. Perhaps his most famous trial and certainly the most time consuming-it still remains the longest criminal jury trial in U.S. Federal Court history-was The Pizza Connection; the name came from accusations of drug money laundering through pizza parlors in New York City. When the U.S. Attorney put two warring mafia families on trial, the case played out like a drama between the Capulets and the Montagues with Mr. Kennedy retained as chief council representing one of the godfathers, Sicilian mob boss Gaetano Badalamenti. Wire taps were the basis for charges against six Americans raising money in New York to buy weapons for the IRA in Ireland. As lead council, Mr. Kennedy won an acquittal for all six men. He also won clemency from New York Governor Mario Cuomo for Jean Harris, the private girls' school headmistress who was in prison for the notorious murder of her lover, Scarsdale Diet doctor Herman Tarnower. Mr. Kennedy worked on only one divorce case in his career and although the settlement was sealed, reliable sources reported that Ivana Trump was very pleased. There were many pro-bono cases about which no one has written. And there were many times when people from all walks of life, the high, the low, and the undocumented, sought Kennedy's advice privately and many times he privately reached out to connections, sometimes in the government, sometimes in the underworld. As general council to High Times Magazine for 41 years, Mr. Kennedy and his friend, the magazine's founder, the late Tom Forcade, sought to subvert prohibition of marijuana. When a reporter recently asked Mr. Kennedy how he kept High Times out of trouble for so long, he replied simply that he had never asked or allowed them to do anything illegal but added: \"At High Times we will never forget what was done in the name of law enforcement to our scarred arrestees, and those who still rot in prison for daring to try to enjoy themselves peacefully and harmlessly.\" Mr. Kennedy was the consummate gentleman, with a quick Irish wit and a quick Irish temper. But he very rarely raised his voice, being the personification of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy: Speak softly but carry a big stick. The romance between Michael Kennedy and Eleanora, his wife of forty-seven years, is the stuff of fairy tales. Marrying after love at first sight, they never spent a night apart and sometimes signed their names as one word. Although not an attorney, Mrs. Kennedy was her husband's most trusted associate and confidant working entirely behind the scenes on every case, becoming an unofficial voir dire expert. The couple eschewed the label 'socialite' but could be seen often at benefits for Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, the Central Park Conservancy and the United Nations. They gave as many parties as they attended, a number of which were chronicled in New York Magazine and the New York Social Diary. When not working or traveling, Mr. Kennedy spent his time between New York City, his Hamptons home Kilkare, his old Key West cottage in West Palm Beach and his house in Ireland's Black Valley. Michael John Kennedy, who died at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, was born in the state of Washington in 1937. After boarding school in Washington, he attended University of California at Berkeley and Hastings Law School. Besides his wife Eleanora, he leaves his daughters Anna Safir and Lisa Kennedy, his son Scott Hamilton Kennedy, three granddaughters and two grandsons. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Wednesday from 2-4 and 6-8pm. The funeral service will be held on Thursday at 10am at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle, 60th Street and Columbus Avenue. 1/3\n",

      "DRAZEN--Ruth Yorkin. We mourn the loss of Ruth Yorkin Drazen-mother, filmmaker and pioneer in genetics-who died quietly in her sleep on Monday evening at the age of 97. Ruth was born in Washington, PA on May 15, 1918, the daughter of Jesse Sachs Yorkin and Maurice A. Yorkin. Ruth adored classical music from early childhood on, studying piano at the Curtis School of Music with Henry Kaufman. In 1938 she married fellow Curtis student, Mario Berini, and they moved to New York City, where Mario began his career as a tenor with the Met. Their only child, Anton, died in infancy of a rare genetic disease, and Ruth's grief sparked her interest in curing genetic illnesses. She spent years working tirelessly as executive director of The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The National Genetics Foundation. When her second husband, New York attorney Jerome Drazen, died of prostate cancer in 1988, she developed an abiding passion for the subject of humanism in medicine, expressing it through the making of documentary films, which she continued to create into her early nineties. Her first film, \"When Doctors Get Cancer,\" was a sensitive look at doctors treating other doctors, in the hope that it might make more humane the care that physicians gave, when they were able to observe themselves as cancer patients. Five other award-winning films followed, most of them shown on PBS. They included, \"The Choice is Yours,\" the inspirational life of the great psychiatrist, Victor Frankl, \"A Wayfayer's Journey; Listening to Mahler;\" \"Notes From the Edge, the Diary of Peter J. Morgan, M.D.,\" an intimate narrative of the last two years of the life of a 29-year old physician diagnosed with cancer, and \"Healing Through Humanism,\" a five DVD teaching series devoted to the practice of compassionate medicine. Ruth was an intellectual and spiritual inspiration to everyone she touched, and will be sorely missed. Ruth is survived by a son, Myron Drazen and daughter-in-law, Lucille; a sister, Martha Yorkin Berman; two step-sons, Michael and Roger Drazen and seven grandchildren, Julie, Debra, Jacob, Dylan, Emily, Kate and Zoe Drazen. She was predeceased by a son, Anton Berini, as well as brother Alan \"Bud\" Yorkin; husbands Mario Berini and Jerome Drazen.

      "EISENPRESSER--George, passed away on January 22, 2016, surrounded by his beloved wife, Therese, and son, Jackson. He was 98 years of age. George was born on April 23, 1917 in Brooklyn, New York, and attended both City College and Pratt Institute. George was an accomplished businessman, Chairman and CEO of National Die and Button Mould Company. He loved sports, including fishing, golfing, skiing and horse racing. And was a great comrade among his peers. He practiced hatha yoga, deep breathing and exercised throughout his life. He also enjoyed collecting art and adding to his collection-and loaned selected pieces to museums. He had a sense of humor and outstanding charm with elegance and wit. Everyone loved him-children, adults, friends and peers. His writings and his conversations were always enlightening to hear. He was a World War II veteran and fought in battles and campaigns, including Ardennes, Central Europe, Rhineland, Normandy, Northern France, and Belgium. Throughout his life he belonged to many clubs, including the Seawane Country Club and the Lone Star Boat Club. He was a religious man and a member of Central Synagogue. For over 70 years he designed and manufactured varieties of metal stampings-nailheads, studs, rhinestones and settings, metal and covered buttons, buckles, and other metal works. His customers included leaders in the fashion industry, automotive, aviation, and the United States Military. He loved people and could converse with anyone on any level-he would always light up a room. His time in World War II as a French interpreter and radar specialist in the anti-aircraft division, and his participation in the Battle of the Bulge and the invasion of Normandy left him with many great stories that he loved to share. These stories always interested everyone who met him. He is survived by his wife-Therese; sister-Hilda; four children-Jackson/Marina, Marvin/Victoria, Robert, Eileen; two stepchildren-Pamela/Jay, James/Ana; eight grandchildren-Lana/David, Ivy, Abigail, Cooper, Maria, Marella, Brian, Tod; and his loyal dog-Guy. George will be deeply missed. A service will be held at Frank E. Campbell on January 28th at 10am to celebrate his life and profound contribution. 1/3\n",

      "REICH--Dr. Robert (Bob), a psychiatrist who treated patients in his Upper East Side and Great Neck practices and a clinical assistant professor at Mt. Sinai Medical School, died on Monday at 79. Born in Montreal, he attended McGill University, edited The McGill Daily, and earned his M.D. at the University of Saskatchewan, where he met Mary, his wife of 54 years. As head of Psychiatry for the New York City Welfare Department under Mayor Koch, he waged a prescient fight against the impending homeless crisis. His patients ranged from celebrities to the indigent, and he was deeply committed to each one as an individual. A broad smile and a winning sense of humor told you instantly that you were in the presence of someone who would sympathetically take the full measure of your being. His stamina was superhuman; he worked long hours and still made himself available round the clock until the day he entered the hospital. His involvement was uncommonly broad, running from child to geriatric, from drugs and talk therapy, to being a pioneer in public psychiatry. Lover of hootenannies, Leadbelly, and opera; gourmet and wine connoisseur; tennis player and fan; magnanimous host and storyteller, Dr. Reich is survived by Mary, two children, Jim and Sharon, and three grandchildren. A funeral service will be held at Riverside North Chapel in Great Neck, on Friday, January 29, at 11:30 am. 1/3\n",

      "HUDNER--Hope Freeman. Artist, Designer, Mother and Friend. Hope F. Hudner died at home in Little Compton, RI on January 14, 2016 following a thirteen month battle with glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer. Hope is survived by her husband of 40 years, Michael, and her daughter, Bay, who were deeply involved as caregivers and comforters during the past year, and were at her side at the time of her peaceful passing. Hope is also survived by her aunt, Judy Freeman N. Gross; brothers, Ambassador Charles \"Chas\" W. Freeman, Jr. (Margaret Carpenter) and Robert P. Freeman (Inge Reist); their five children and nine grandchildren (Hope's grand-nieces and -nephews); siblings-in-law, Mr. Kennedy Hudner (Jennifer), Ms. Cornelia Futterman (Michael), and Ms. Kristina Beitman (Harty), and their five children. Hope was born on January 11, 1951 in Nassau, The Bahamas, and lived there until age 10, then alternating time in Southern California with years in Providence and Bristol, RI. Hope was predeceased by her son, Michael Ripley (\"Rip\") Hudner, and her parents (father, Charles Wellman Freeman, and mother, Carla Park Freeman, who died when Hope was 20 months old). Hope was largely raised by her two sets of deceased grandparents, Hovey T. and Marjorie W. Freeman of Providence and Bristol, and George C. and Fentress K. Park of Wollaston, MA and Roaring Brook, MI. Hope graduated from The Lincoln School, Providence (1969), Smith College (1973), and also acquired an MFA from New York University. The family lived in New York City from 1974 through 1994, and then resided in Little Compton and Providence, RI. Hope was an accomplished artist and designer with a portfolio including work in graphic, interior, jewelry, and apparel design. These efforts led to her 2013 creation of Hope Hudner Designs, focused on elegant silk infinity scarves. Hope was deeply involved in Rhode Island public service, including, at various times, board and/or development responsibilities at Moses Brown School, Women & Infants Hospital, Rhode Islanders Sponsoring Education (RISE), RISD Museum, Perennial Planters, The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America (Rhode Island), and Providence Preservation Society. Hope's social involvements included membership in the Providence Art Club, Colony Club of New York City, Lyford Cay Club, Sakonnet Golf Club, and Sakonnet Point Club. Hope had great admiration for the natural world and actively cultivated a sense of wonder: she was a faithful student of plants and flowers (as evidenced by the thousands of bulbs planted across Rhode Island, Maine, and New York); she loved sailing with her family and friends (countless excursions on Narragansett Bay and longer trips to Maine, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Ireland number among the most special); and her keen curiosity led her to explore the far corners of the world, from Spain and Taiwan at age 18 to Antarctica at 49, covering every other continent and many countries in between. Hope had enormous energy, deep intelligence, natural grace, and remarkable warmth. She believed that life presented endless opportunity to learn, remarking on the tenth anniversary of her son's death that, \"Each time it rains in our lives, we are given an opportunity for further growth. I am grateful for the challenges in my life as chances to grow and blossom.\" Hope faced her illness with the same fortitude and poise. While she was indeed a lifelong learner, Hope was perhaps most notable as a teacher of these invaluable lessons to the rest of us. Hope felt a profound duty to embrace everyone she encountered with love and kindness, and she shared this love of people and life like water from a fire hose. All within range were enriched by her presence and generosity of spirit. Hope inspired people to think lovingly and boldly on behalf of the larger community, themselves, and their friends, prompting many to find more inside themselves to enhance their own lives and those of others. A college classmate of Bay's said it beautifully in a recent note to Hope: \"You feature prominently as an inspiration for the life I want to live-to pursue my interests, to live fully and with panache, to spend time in nature, and, most of all, to be kind to people. I know I am just one of the many, many people you affect in this way!\" A celebration of Hope's life will be held in Little Compton in early June on a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions in Hope's memory be made to: the Rip Hudner Memorial Fund at Moses Brown School, Providence; Dr. Patrick Wen's Research in Neuro-Oncology at Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston; or a charity of your choice. Above all, the family encourages you to remember Hope by engaging with the world through love and kindness. 1/3\n",

He is survived by his devoted partner of 43 years, Eileen M. Lach, and his loving sisters May Berenbaum and Diane Berenbaum. Mr. Berenbaum, who earned his advanced degree in computer science from Princeton, spent more than 25 years as a scientist at Bell Labs, and most recently was the senior architect designing chips for Microchip Technologies. Holder of several patents, he also taught at The Cooper Union. To his extended circle of friends, Alan is remembered as an intoxicating, incisive conversationalist, at ease with subjects from quantum physics to Formula One racing to the absurdities of today's politics. He wore his brilliance with grace and humor. A celebration of his life and spirit will be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel at 1076 Madison Avenue at 1:30pm on Friday, January 29. 1/3\n",

His B-24 was named \"The Stork Club.\" When praised for his bravery, he would invariably respond: \"Was there a choice?\" Cheers erupted from a crowd on the beach when, piloting his plane home to the states after the war, he dipped his wings over the Inwood Country Club. Mr. Sloan was born in New York City on March 20, 1924. He graduated from the Woodmere Academy and Pawling Preparatory School, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, Class of '45W. He and his late wife, Sonny, along with George and Barbara Bush, were the only two married couples on campus. Dreams of business school were dashed by financial necessity and he joined his father's insurance company, Harris, Sloan and Finn. Characteristically, he turned the experience into a colorful one, representing clients such as Restaurant Associates; Richard Burton, who dispatched him to Rome to deliver a diamond he'd bought at auction for Elizabeth Taylor, or Cartier to present a love bracelet to Valentino, who insisted Howard personally fasten it on his wrist. He became an art insurer, developing great interest and knowledge of art in the process, befriending numerous artists and inspiring a lifetime of collecting: Mayan and PreColumbian sculpture, works by artists as diverse as Giacometti and Bill King, Henry Moore and Lindner. He acquired an art gallery, Multiples, for his wife, Sonny, and Marian Goodman to run. In 1990, he was invited by his friend and mentor, Charles Wohlstetter, to become a partner in the latter's acquisitions of hundreds of independent telephone companies from Alaska to California. They formed Continental Telephone, later known as Contel, in 1962. The company then agreed to be acquired by GTE, a combination that created the nation's largest local telephone company. Sloan remained on the Board of GTE until it was restructured as Verizon. In 1968, an American syndicate acquired an 18th century chateau in Bordeaux with Wohlstetter and Sloan installed as new owners. Chateau Bouscaut was the second most beautiful vineyard in Bordeaux, Sloan proclaimed, second, he said, because he didn't want to boast. Among the many American guests who flocked to visit, his favorite was Mary Lindsay, whom he overheard saying to her husband, then mayor of NYC, \"John, if I have to see one more vineyard, I'll kill myself.\" To Sloan's eternal regret, Bouscat was sold in 1980. Mayor Lindsay brought Sloan onto the board of the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1984. At that time, according to Andre Bishop, current artistic director, \"Nobody would give you a nickel for the Beaumont.\" It is now one of the leading theatrical companies in New York, if not the world. Mr. Sloan served on the Board until his death on Thursday. In 1977, Sloan joined the Board of Trustees of the New York Blood Center, of which he was Chairman from 1993 to 2000, nominating his successor, Howard Milstein. In January 2013, a congressional extension prepared by Representative Carolyn Maloney in recognition of Mr. Sloan's 15 years of distinguished service and dedication to NYBC's mission, was entered into the congressional record. She cited his humanitarian status and commended his leadership and tireless advocacy. For several years, he presided as Chairman of Northside Center for Child Development, founded by Kenneth and Mamie Clarke, earning a colleague's recent comment, \"There was a time this place wouldn't have existed without Howard Sloan.\" He and his wife are to be honored for their dedication to Northside at a gala in May 2017. Howard Sloan died of kidney failure in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital on January 21, 2016. Handsome as a film star, he will be remembered for his elegance and extraordinary wit. He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Kathryn Roth of Weston, Massachusetts, Gillis Cone of Woodbury, Connecticut; a son, Douglas Sloan, of Palm Beach; a stepdaughter, Paulette Bartlett Robinson, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren. Interment will be private and a memorial service will take place at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home on Wednesday, February 10th. 1/3\n",

After 96 years of laughing, loving, shouting, learning, teaching, and building, Henry, the beloved patriarch of the Kibel family, passed away peacefully Wednesday night surrounded by family and friends. Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12\" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96. On second thought, his memory was not so great for the last 10 years, so maybe the salt was not so good. Henry is survived by his sister, three children, eight grandchildren, and many nephews and nieces. The funeral will be held on Friday, January 29 at 11:30am at Frank Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue. We will sorely miss him. The Kibel and Levenson Families 1/3\n",

      "SMITH--Howard. NYU Lutheran's board and staff are deeply saddened by the passing of chair emeritus Howard Smith. As chairman of Lutheran Medical Center and Augustana Center from 1966 until 2004, Smith, who died Thursday at age 85, left an indelible legacy on southwest Brooklyn. With his friend New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the American Lutheran Church, Mr. Smith brokered the 1977 expansion and relocation of Lutheran Medical Center from 4th Avenue and 46th Street to its present location, a former warehouse at 55th Street and 2nd Avenue in Sunset Park. He facilitated the creation of the Sunset Park Family Health Center, now called NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers, the second largest federally qualified health center network in the nation. He created a lasting financial foundation for Lutheran through Health Plus, an innovative government-sponsored insurance program for low-income residents. Lutheran's sale of Health Plus to Amerigroup in 2011 created an endowment that continues to help modernize the health system. Mr. Smith, a lifelong Brooklyn resident, was chairman emeritus of the United Hospital Fund, former president of the Brooklyn Public Library Board of Trustees, and past vice president and director of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Smith received a bachelor's in chemical engineering from Princeton University and served in the U.S. Army. He served 40 years as president of Virginia Dare Extract Company, which was founded by his grandfather Bernard, and was a former director of Dime Savings Bank of New York before it merged with Washington Mutual in 2002. He is predeceased by his wife, Elsie, and survived by his three children, Howard Jr., Jean, and Lilla, and grandchildren. NYU Lutheran mourns as we celebrate Mr. Smith's life and legacy. A wake will be held at Clavin Funeral Home, 7722 4th Ave., Brooklyn, on Tuesday, February 2, at 4-8pm. Services will be held at the Lutheran Church of the Good Shepherd, 7420 4th Ave., Brooklyn, on Wednesday, February 3, at 10 am. 1/3\n",

      "KIBEL--Henry. After 96 years of laughing, loving, shouting, learning, teaching, and building, Henry, the beloved patriarch of the Kibel family, passed away peacefully Wednesday night surrounded by family and friends. Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12\" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96. On second thought, his memory was not so great for the last 10 years, so maybe the salt was not so good. Henry is survived by his sister, three children, eight grandchildren, and many nephews and nieces. The funeral will be held on Friday, January 29 at 11:30am at Frank Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue. We will sorely miss him. The Kibel and Levenson Families 1/3\n",

Murphy and his wife, Pamela; Eileen and her husband, Jeffrey Forsyth; Kathleen and her husband, Lance Scott; Sheila and her husband, Michael Sproule; Annemarie and her husband, Kevin Casey; and his sister Irene McInerney. He was a loving grandfather to Casey, Kaitlyn, Timothy, Matthew, Sean, Patrick, Michael, Brendan, Megan and Liam. After being honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy after World War II, he graduated from Fordham University and New York Law School. A member of the New York judiciary for 40 years, he served 15 years as a trial judge and 25 years as a Justice of the Appellate Division First Department, with the last 20 years as the Court's Presiding Justice. When he left the Court, he joined the New York law firm of Kelley, Drye and Warren as Of Counsel. Throughout his career Judge Murphy was an ardent supporter of providing full legal services and justice to the underprivileged and incarcerated. A gracious man with a generous heart and strong religious beliefs, he took counsel only from his own conscience. The loves of Tim's life were his wife, Sheila, his family, his friends and his life in the law.

Born October 10, 1930 in Boston, MA, he was the son of a Boston theatre owner, Rufus and his wife Sylvia Somerby. He graduated from Williams College in 1952.

      "GROSS--Martin L. Martin L. Gross of New London, NH and Ocean Ridge, FL died on Tuesday, January 26, 2016 in Ushuaia, Argentina following a stroke suffered en route to Antarctica. He was 77 years old. Martin's adventures began in New York City where he was born on October 22, 1938. As a young child, Martin and his older brother, Woolf, were dispatched to summer camps and later to working cattle ranches in Utah during the summer months to escape the polio outbreaks that plagued New York City in the years following World War II. After high school, Martin headed north to Cambridge, MA where he attended both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, graduating from the latter in 1964. Before embarking on his first job as a law clerk in New Hampshire, Martin and his first wife, the late Caroline Lord Gross, purchased a Volkswagen pop-up camper and drove to Alaska with Martin's mother, Harriet. Harriet slept in the camper; Martin and Caroline slept outdoors in a tent. After several weeks of abysmal weather the camper was coated with a thick layer of adobe-colored mud. When the trio returned to Concord and washed the car for the first time, it was in pristine condition. Thereafter, Martin never worried much if his car was dirty. Following his clerkship, Martin joined the Concord, New Hampshire law firm of Sulloway & Hollis, P.L.L.C. from which he retired (while maintaining senior counsel status) in 2015 after more than 50 years of distinguished service to his clients and to the New Hampshire Bar. As with everything else in life, Martin viewed the practice of law as an adventure. He delighted in besting his adversaries and often developed long and lasting friendships with them. His in-house writing boot camps were legendary and his wit and charm were ever present at the office and in the courtroom. While working full-time as a Sulloway lawyer, Martin served three terms as the mayor of Concord. During these years, Martin developed a real talent for cooking. This was driven by necessity since Caroline's busy schedule at the State House meant she was often home late. Undeterred by a complete lack of training (and by a lifelong aversion to cookbooks) Martin channeled his inner top chef and produced thousands of wonderful meals for friends and family. The informal \"Sunday Suppers\" he enjoyed with his close friends Malcolm and Susan McLane, Liz and Dennis Hager and other dear Concord friends were a social staple. Six years after the loss of his beloved Caroline in 1993, fate intervened and Martin met his second wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, architect, New London, NH. The meeting occurred at Chicago's O'Hare Airport where both were waiting to board a flight back to New Hampshire. It would turn out to be a kismet flight on United Airlines (friendly skies indeed!) with Deirdre sitting in seat 2B and Martin (who always flew coach and never paid for upgrades) inexplicably seated in seat 3B directly behind Deirdre. Seeing that seat 2A was open, Martin leaned over and graciously asked Deirdre \"Can I buy you dinner?\" They have been having dinner together ever since. This episode gave Martin plenty of fodder for his expansive repertoire of bad puns....\"United\" Airlines.... 2B or not to be.... Martin made the most of it. Six months later, in July 2000, Martin and Deirdre were married. During their 15 year marriage, Martin and Deirdre traveled the world. Despite temporary setbacks (Martin's surgeries, lost luggage, etc.) they visited South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Central America and multiple European countries. This past September, Martin and Deirdre rented an Airstream trailer and toured Grand Teton and Yellowstone parks; they did not have to sleep outdoors. Over the past few years, one of Martin's happiest endeavors was building a warm winter getaway in Ocean Ridge, FL. He loved living in a house designed by his wife, Deirdre. Two weeks ago, Martin and Deirdre left for Antarctica; a trip that was to be Martin's last great adventure. While southbound on his way to Antarctica on a cruise ship he suffered a stroke and had to be transferred to a passing northbound vessel. That ship docked safely in Ushuaia (the cruise's point of origin) where Martin underwent surgery to relieve a subdural hematoma. Despite excellent care and a successful surgery, Martin contracted an infection from which he did not recover. Martin loved the spontaneity and unpredictability of travel. He would have appreciated the irony of his last great adventure. Martin is survived by his wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, of New London, NH; his brother, Woolf Gross (spouse Lucy) of Arlington, VA; a nephew, William Gross, of Arlington, VA; two cousins, John and Charles Gross, both of New York City, and his brother-in-law (affectionately referred to as \"hermano west,\" Hugh McCrystal (spouse Polly). In addition, Martin is survived by dozens of close friends including his childhood friend, Peter Soloman (who Martin always introduced as \"the man I've never not known\"), Will and Sherry Rogers and their two daughters, Anne and Catherine (who were Martin's goddaughters and who lovingly called him \"Uncle Martin\"), Peter and Jean Burling, Rick and Karla Karash, Alex Bernhart and Myra Mayman, Merwyn and Carol Bagan, and others too numerous to name. In honor of Martin's extraordinary service to his community, donations can be made to the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation (on whose board he served for many years), to the Capitol Center for the Arts, to New Hampshire Public Radio, or to the charity of one's choice. Funeral arrangements and information about a celebration of Martin's life will be announced at a later date. 1/3\n",

      "REICH--Dr. Robert (Bob), a psychiatrist who treated patients in his Upper East Side and Great Neck practices and a clinical assistant professor at Mt. Sinai Medical School, died on Monday at 79. Born in Montreal, he attended McGill University, edited The McGill Daily, and earned his M.D. at the University of Saskatchewan, where he met Mary, his wife of 54 years. As head of Psychiatry for the New York City Welfare Department under Mayor Koch, he waged a prescient fight against the impending homeless crisis. His patients ranged from celebrities to the indigent, and he was deeply committed to each one as an individual. A broad smile and a winning sense of humor told you instantly that you were in the presence of someone who would sympathetically take the full measure of your being. His stamina was superhuman; he worked long hours and still made himself available round the clock until the day he entered the hospital. His involvement was uncommonly broad, running from child to geriatric, from drugs and talk therapy, to being a pioneer in public psychiatry. Lover of hootenannies, Leadbelly, and opera; gourmet and wine connoisseur; tennis player and fan; magnanimous host and storyteller, Dr. Reich is survived by Mary, two children, Jim and Sharon, and three grandchildren.

      "FINBERG--Laurence, MD. Leader in Academic Pediatrics: Born May 20, 1923, died January 22, 2016. Laurence Finberg, a pediatrician and scientist, was known for his contributions to the management of salt and water balance in children. He served as Chair of Pediatrics at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Downstate in Brooklyn from 1982- 1994, and was Dean of the School of Medicine at SUNY Downstate from 1988-1991. A native of Chicago, Dr. Finberg received an SB (1944) and MD degree (1946) from the University of Chicago. In August, 1950 during a major epidemic of poliomyelitis, when he was the Admitting Officer for Contagious Diseases at Baltimore City Hospitals, he took the bold step of integrating previously segregated medical services by admitting an African American adult to previously all white wards, breaking the color barrier. Dr. Finberg served on the faculty at Johns Hopkins from 1951-1963. He became Chair of Pediatrics at Montefiore Hospital and Professor of Pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1963. After moving to San Francisco in 1995, he continued to teach Pediatrics, serving on the faculty of both Stanford and UCSF medical schools. Dr. Finberg was beloved by medical students and residents and as teacher and served as a role model for countless young physicians and aspiring physicians. His work led to life-saving treatment for children, especially children from disadvantaged backgrounds all over the world, who have been the victims of dehydration. Dr. Finberg was Chair of the Academy of Pediatrics Committees on Nutrition and Environmental Hazards. An expert in the diagnosis and treatment of lead poisoning in children, he promoted the idea of testing the environment (obtaining lead levels in paint and other areas in the environment), rather than waiting to find high levels in the blood of children. His arguments against \"using children as the canaries in the coal mine,\" changed the emphasis and undoubtedly prevented disease in many children exposed to peeling paint and poor housing conditions. A gentle man, he was incredibly devoted to his friends and family, and will be remembered for his good natured sense of humor that lightened all occasions. In addition to being a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, he is remembered by his family and friends for his love of chocolate, travel, good wines, and the Chicago Cubs. He is survived by his wife of 20 years, Joann Quane-Finberg, his children Robert W. Finberg, Jeanne Finberg, James M. Finberg, their spouses Joyce, Robert, Melanie, and many loving grandchildren and great-grand children. His first wife, Harriet Levinson Finberg, died in 1994 after 49 years of marriage. 1/3\n",

Richard A. \"Buz\" Cooper, MD, a pioneering cancer research scientist who became one of the world's leading authorities on physician supply and the causes of healthcare disparities, died peacefully at home in New York City on January 15, 2016. During more than 50 years as a physician-scientist, Dr. Cooper had a distinguished and diverse career. He began his clinical and investigative training in hematology and oncology in the 1960s at the National Cancer Institute and Boston City Hospital's Thorndike Laboratory. He later joined the University of Pennsylvania faculty as Chief of Hematology, founded the Abramson Cancer Center, and taught in the Leonard Davis Institute, both at Penn. A native of Milwaukee, Dr. Cooper returned there as dean of the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1985, subsequently founding and directing MCW's Health Policy Institute. Among the first to recognize a potential doctor shortage, Dr. Cooper was a leading authority on the economic and social dynamics underlying healthcare spending and utilization. Increasingly he studied healthcare through the lens of poverty; his book about the effect of income inequality on poor healthcare outcomes will be published by Johns Hopkins University Press later this year. He was preceded in death by his first wife, Jacqueline Cooper, and is survived by his second wife, Andrea Pastor; his current wife, Barrie Cassileth; daughter, Stephanie (David) Cooper Cornelius; son, Jonathan (Eileen Harris) Cooper; and grandchildren, Jordan, Matthew, and Halle Cooper.

      "DRAZEN--Ruth Yorkin. We mourn the loss of Ruth Yorkin Drazen-mother, filmmaker and pioneer in genetics-who died quietly in her sleep on Monday evening at the age of 97. Ruth was born in Washington, PA on May 15, 1918, the daughter of Jesse Sachs Yorkin and Maurice A. Yorkin. Ruth adored classical music from early childhood on, studying piano at the Curtis School of Music with Henry Kaufman. In 1938 she married fellow Curtis student, Mario Berini, and they moved to New York City, where Mario began his career as a tenor with the Met. Their only child, Anton, died in infancy of a rare genetic disease, and Ruth's grief sparked her interest in curing genetic illnesses. She spent years working tirelessly as executive director of The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The National Genetics Foundation. When her second husband, New York attorney Jerome Drazen, died of prostate cancer in 1988, she developed an abiding passion for the subject of humanism in medicine, expressing it through the making of documentary films, which she continued to create into her early nineties. Her first film, \"When Doctors Get Cancer,\" was a sensitive look at doctors treating other doctors, in the hope that it might make more humane the care that physicians gave, when they were able to observe themselves as cancer patients. Five other award-winning films followed, most of them shown on PBS. They included, \"The Choice is Yours,\" the inspirational life of the great psychiatrist, Victor Frankl, \"A Wayfayer's Journey; Listening to Mahler;\" \"Notes From the Edge, the Diary of Peter J. Morgan, M.D.,\" an intimate narrative of the last two years of the life of a 29-year old physician diagnosed with cancer, and \"Healing Through Humanism,\" a five DVD teaching series devoted to the practice of compassionate medicine. Ruth was an intellectual and spiritual inspiration to everyone she touched, and will be sorely missed. Ruth is survived by a son, Myron Drazen and daughter-in-law, Lucille; a sister, Martha Yorkin Berman; two step-sons, Michael and Roger Drazen and seven grandchildren, Julie, Debra, Jacob, Dylan, Emily, Kate and Zoe Drazen. She was predeceased by a son, Anton Berini, as well as brother Alan \"Bud\" Yorkin; husbands Mario Berini and Jerome Drazen. 1/3\n",

After 96 years of laughing, loving, shouting, learning, teaching, and building, Henry, the beloved patriarch of the Kibel family, passed away peacefully Wednesday night surrounded by family and friends. Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12\" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96. On second thought, his memory was not so great for the last 10 years, so maybe the salt was not so good.

      "SLOAN--Howard, WWII bomber pilot, former Chairman of New York Blood Center, died at 91. From a base in East Anglia during World War II, 19 year old Howard Sloan flew 33 missions over Germany. His B-24 was named \"The Stork Club.\" When praised for his bravery, he would invariably respond: \"Was there a choice?\" Cheers erupted from a crowd on the beach when, piloting his plane home to the states after the war, he dipped his wings over the Inwood Country Club. Mr. Sloan was born in New York City on March 20, 1924. He graduated from the Woodmere Academy and Pawling Preparatory School, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, Class of '45W. He and his late wife, Sonny, along with George and Barbara Bush, were the only two married couples on campus. Dreams of business school were dashed by financial necessity and he joined his father's insurance company, Harris, Sloan and Finn. Characteristically, he turned the experience into a colorful one, representing clients such as Restaurant Associates; Richard Burton, who dispatched him to Rome to deliver a diamond he'd bought at auction for Elizabeth Taylor, or Cartier to present a love bracelet to Valentino, who insisted Howard personally fasten it on his wrist. He became an art insurer, developing great interest and knowledge of art in the process, befriending numerous artists and inspiring a lifetime of collecting: Mayan and PreColumbian sculpture, works by artists as diverse as Giacometti and Bill King, Henry Moore and Lindner. He acquired an art gallery, Multiples, for his wife, Sonny, and Marian Goodman to run. In 1990, he was invited by his friend and mentor, Charles Wohlstetter, to become a partner in the latter's acquisitions of hundreds of independent telephone companies from Alaska to California. They formed Continental Telephone, later known as Contel, in 1962. The company then agreed to be acquired by GTE, a combination that created the nation's largest local telephone company. Sloan remained on the Board of GTE until it was restructured as Verizon. In 1968, an American syndicate acquired an 18th century chateau in Bordeaux with Wohlstetter and Sloan installed as new owners. Chateau Bouscaut was the second most beautiful vineyard in Bordeaux, Sloan proclaimed, second, he said, because he didn't want to boast. Among the many American guests who flocked to visit, his favorite was Mary Lindsay, whom he overheard saying to her husband, then mayor of NYC, \"John, if I have to see one more vineyard, I'll kill myself.\" To Sloan's eternal regret, Bouscat was sold in 1980. Mayor Lindsay brought Sloan onto the board of the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1984. At that time, according to Andre Bishop, current artistic director, \"Nobody would give you a nickel for the Beaumont.\" It is now one of the leading theatrical companies in New York, if not the world. Mr. Sloan served on the Board until his death on Thursday. In 1977, Sloan joined the Board of Trustees of the New York Blood Center, of which he was Chairman from 1993 to 2000, nominating his successor, Howard Milstein. In January 2013, a congressional extension prepared by Representative Carolyn Maloney in recognition of Mr. Sloan's 15 years of distinguished service and dedication to NYBC's mission, was entered into the congressional record. She cited his humanitarian status and commended his leadership and tireless advocacy. For several years, he presided as Chairman of Northside Center for Child Development, founded by Kenneth and Mamie Clarke, earning a colleague's recent comment, \"There was a time this place wouldn't have existed without Howard Sloan.\" He and his wife are to be honored for their dedication to Northside at a gala in May 2017. Howard Sloan died of kidney failure in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital on January 21, 2016. Handsome as a film star, he will be remembered for his elegance and extraordinary wit. He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Kathryn Roth of Weston, Massachusetts, Gillis Cone of Woodbury, Connecticut; a son, Douglas Sloan, of Palm Beach; a stepdaughter, Paulette Bartlett Robinson, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.

Bill was known for his wonderful, witty sense of humor, his kind heart, his charm and elegance and his broad range of interests. He loved water of all kinds-the ocean, the bay, rivers and lakes. There will be a memorial gathering in Sarasota, Florida on Saturday, April 16 and a service at St. Bart's Episcopal Church, 325 Park Ave. at 50th St., NYC on Friday, April 29 at 11am (visitation and reception before and after). In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions in his memory may be made to either the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (www.themmrf.org/donate) or Comfort Zone Camp (www.comfortzone camp.org). Bill had a big aura and lifted us up with it. We will all miss him deeply. 1/3\n",

      "SCHWARTZ--Sol. Sol Schwartz, of Sarasota, Florida passed away on December 25, 2015 at the age of 84. Sol was a gifted and prolific artist, the founder of the nationally acclaimed Options college counseling program, a talented musician, a dedicated art teacher and guidance counselor at Sheepshead Bay High School. Sol was the de facto \"artist in residence\" at Tanglewood Music Center in the Berkshires where he created the iconic graphic of Seiji Ozawa now immortalized on Tanglewood's poster. His work has been exhibited at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, MA, at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, numerous galleries, and is to be featured in an upcoming show at Wigmore Hall, London. A selection of his art can be viewed at www.solschwartz.com. The son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, Sol grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side. As a child, he lugged wet wash up tenements to his father's laundry's customers. Sol started drawing at five. He entered New York City's High School of Music and Art. By 16 Sol had joined the New York Mandolin Symphony Orchestra. He starred in the play \"Tomorrow the World\" as a teen. At 35 he studied cello and played in a quartet, and at 60 learned jazz piano. He studied art at Brooklyn College with New York School artists Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, Alfred Russell, and Robert Jay Wolff. Following his graduation in 1952, he taught art and, after receiving a Master's degree in Counseling, served as a guidance counselor at Sheepshead Bay High School. Frustrated by the limited college and financial aid resources available to his students, Schwartz created a program to help the students explore options, navigate applications and obtain aid. Without assistance from the public school administration, Schwartz designed the Options program, obtained mainframe computer access, and researched college and aid data nationwide. He integrated a culture of participation and giving back: seniors worked and assisted the younger students in the Options office. It was the first of its kind in the country. After Options was instituted, students gained entrance to elite universities, graduated without debilitating debt, and achieved significant careers in the arts, investment banking, teaching, medicine and public health. Sol's Options program relocated to New York City's Goddard Riverside in 1985 where Sol built it into the gold standard college access program that today is a key partner to Michelle Obama's Reach Higher Initiative. The program remains as Sol intended it: non-profit, free of charge, available to all, providing the finest level of college and financial aid counseling services, all delivered free with one proviso, that Options' recipients give back to others when they can. After retiring from the school system, Sol returned to his first love: drawing. Combining his love of art with his love of music, theatre and dance, Sol began bringing a sketchbook to performances. Through the years he has sketched Andre Previn, Itzhak Perlman, Emanual Ax, Seiji Ozawa, Yo-Yo Ma, James Levine, Kurt Mazur, Katherine Dunham, Savion Glover, Mark Morris, the Juilliard and Emerson string quartets and others in performance. Sol said he drew during performances to convey \"the spirit of the concert that ineffable nature of a great performance. \"His art is published in the \"Drawing Music\" series and other books, all of artists drawn in performance. Sol's work is in many of the performers' homes. His art often includes a written comment from performers, such as cellist Sharon Robinson, who wrote \"Sol, thank you for capturing my soul.\" The unique nature of Sol's art - artists captured in performance - is reflected in the dual introductions to his first book, Drawing Music: The Tanglewood Sketchbooks, with one introduction by Joel Smirnoff, the Juilliard String Quartet's first violinist, who wrote \"Schwartz has captured the unique stage and musical personality of each performer. And the sound of music permeates the atmosphere of each portrait...As performers, we as artists are ever grateful that Sol Schwartz has helped our expression linger in the air yet a moment longer. We celebrate him for his work and for his musicality,\" and the other introduction by art critic Colin Eisler, who wrote \"Sol's lyrical lines pay homage to the musician... retracing the mysterious union of individual, instrument and passion...[his] pages let us share the collective joy of hearing and seeing music made, we the beneficiaries of his arresting lines in all their ecstatic freedom and harmony.\" Sol was dedicated to helping people experience the joy of learning. He was a donor to many organizations, including Shakespeare & Company, Children's Book Project, Theater for a New Audience, Kids4Harmony, Norman Rockwell Museum, Tanglewood, Jacob's Pillow, Ringling School of Art and Design, the Guitar Society, Asolo State Theater, La Musica, Perlman Music Program and the Florida Studio Theater. He also quietly helped many others when he saw an opportunity. The force of his interest in people and life, and his determination to help others was palpable. Sol was a loving husband to his first wife Lillian, a devoted father to Risa and David, and a delighted grandfather to John Cortner. After Lillian's death in 1999, Sol married Elayne P. Bernstein, who shared his passion for the arts and generosity, introducing him to Shakespeare & Company in Lenox. MA where he served as a trustee. In addition to his immediate family, Sol is survived by several cousins and countless friends who will deeply miss him. Memorial services will be held in Sarasota, FL on February 13 at 2pm and in Lenox, MA during the summer of 2016. Condolences may be sent to the family at P.O. Box 73, Lenox, MA 01240. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Sol's honor to the Children's Book Project (www.children sbookproject.org, 3433 21st Street, San Francisco, CA 94110), Shakespeare & Company (www.shakespeare.org, 70 Kemble Street, Lenox, MA 01240) and Kids4Harmony (www.berkshirechildren.org, 480 West Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201). 1/3\n",

      "HUDNER--Hope Freeman. Artist, Designer, Mother and Friend. Hope F. Hudner died at home in Little Compton, RI on January 14, 2016 following a thirteen month battle with glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer. Hope is survived by her husband of 40 years, Michael, and her daughter, Bay, who were deeply involved as caregivers and comforters during the past year, and were at her side at the time of her peaceful passing. Hope is also survived by her aunt, Judy Freeman N. Gross; brothers, Ambassador Charles \"Chas\" W. Freeman, Jr. (Margaret Carpenter) and Robert P. Freeman (Inge Reist); their five children and nine grandchildren (Hope's grand-nieces and -nephews); siblings-in-law, Mr. Kennedy Hudner (Jennifer), Ms. Cornelia Futterman (Michael), and Ms. Kristina Beitman (Harty), and their five children. Hope was born on January 11, 1951 in Nassau, The Bahamas, and lived there until age 10, then alternating time in Southern California with years in Providence and Bristol, RI. Hope was predeceased by her son, Michael Ripley (\"Rip\") Hudner, and her parents (father, Charles Wellman Freeman, and mother, Carla Park Freeman, who died when Hope was 20 months old). Hope was largely raised by her two sets of deceased grandparents, Hovey T. and Marjorie W. Freeman of Providence and Bristol, and Edward and Fentress K. Park of Wollaston, MA and Roaring Brook, MI. Hope graduated from The Lincoln School, Providence (1969), Smith College (1973), and also acquired an MFA from New York University. The family lived in New York City from 1974 through 1994, and then resided in Little Compton and Providence, RI. Hope was an accomplished artist and designer with a portfolio including work in graphic, interior, jewelry, and apparel design. These efforts led to her 2013 creation of Hope Hudner Designs, focused on elegant silk infinity scarves. Hope was deeply involved in Rhode Island public service, including, at various times, board and/or development responsibilities at Moses Brown School, Women & Infants Hospital, Rhode Islanders Sponsoring Education (RISE), RISD Museum, Perennial Planters, The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America (Rhode Island), and Providence Preservation Society. Hope's social involvements included membership in the Providence Art Club, Colony Club of New York City, Lyford Cay Club, Sakonnet Golf Club, and Sakonnet Point Club. Hope had great admiration for the natural world and actively cultivated a sense of wonder: she was a faithful student of plants and flowers (as evidenced by the thousands of bulbs planted across Rhode Island, Maine, and New York); she loved sailing with her family and friends (countless excursions on Narragansett Bay and longer trips to Maine, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Ireland number among the most special); and her keen curiosity led her to explore the far corners of the world, from Spain and Taiwan at age 18 to Antarctica at 49, covering every other continent and many countries in between. Hope had enormous energy, deep intelligence, natural grace, and remarkable warmth. She believed that life presented endless opportunity to learn, remarking on the tenth anniversary of her son's death that, \"Each time it rains in our lives, we are given an opportunity for further growth. I am grateful for the challenges in my life as chances to grow and blossom.\" Hope faced her illness with the same fortitude and poise. While she was indeed a lifelong learner, Hope was perhaps most notable as a teacher of these invaluable lessons to the rest of us. Hope felt a profound duty to embrace everyone she encountered with love and kindness, and she shared this love of people and life like water from a fire hose. All within range were enriched by her presence and generosity of spirit. Hope inspired people to think lovingly and boldly on behalf of the larger community, themselves, and their friends, prompting many to find more inside themselves to enhance their own lives and those of others. A college classmate of Bay's said it beautifully in a recent note to Hope: \"You feature prominently as an inspiration for the life I want to live-to pursue my interests, to live fully and with panache, to spend time in nature, and, most of all, to be kind to people. I know I am just one of the many, many people you affect in this way!\" A celebration of Hope's life will be held in Little Compton in early June on a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions in Hope's memory be made to: the Rip Hudner Memorial Fund at Moses Brown School, Providence; Dr. Patrick Wen's Research in Neuro-Oncology at Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston; or a charity of your choice. Above all, the family encourages you to remember Hope by engaging with the world through love and kindness. 1/3\n",

      "KAUFMAN--Annette. A passion for music set Annette Kaufman on a fairy-tale course from North Dakota to a conservatory in NYC where she met and fell in love with Louis Kaufman, married him at the age of 18-and seldom left his side for the next 62 years. Mr. Kaufman, a Hollywood legend, played principal violin in over 500 films including Casablanca and Gone with the Wind. In his 2003 memoir, A Fiddler's Tale, he wrote that upon his proposal of marriage, Annette replied that she would like to be his accompanist. For the next 62 years, she was. They lived in Los Angeles, CA in a house designed for them by Lloyd Wright where, at the age of 101, Mrs. Kaufman died peacefully on January 25, 2016. The Kaufmans were well known in the Los Angeles pre-and post-war cultural scene. They were the first collectors of Milton Avery and, being softhearted and generous, helped many struggling painters during Depression-era America. In Brussels after the war, they were shown an obscure piece of music by Vivaldi, The Four Seasons; Mr. Kaufman became the first person to record it. A generous benefactor to many cultural institutions including the Library of Congress, the National Portrait Gallery and the Portland Art Museum, Annette was a vivid raconteur of a time in Europe and Los Angeles that, while largely faded from memory, lived on in her ebullient recounting of it. 1/3\n",

Bernard was predeceased by his wife of 69 years, Laura Redfield Levy, who shared a love of life, travel, and dogs. He is survived by his sons Dean (Janice), Jonathan (Carol), and daughter Marcia Roesch (Geoffrey), and his seven grandchildren and six greatgrandchildren). Bernard was one of the most prominent dealers in early American furniture, first as a partner in the firm of Ginsburg & Levy, founded in 1901, and then from 1973 until his death with the firm Bernard & S. Dean Levy, Inc., of New York. Over the nearly 70 years as an active dealer, he was able to acquire and place a number of the most recognizable pieces in both private and public collections. He was a friend and advisor to many of the great early collectors, many of whose gifts now form the core of major museum collections. These include The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Bayou Bend Collection, The Winterthur Museum and Historic Deerfield among many other institutions. He was always eager to share his knowledge and enthusiasm with collectors, curators, other dealers and especially his family. His eye for the very finest in Americana will be missed. Bernard was an avid and accomplished tennis player winning many local and regional tournaments. Into his seventies he remained active in competitive tennis attaining a national ranking. Anyone who played with or against him can attest to a strong will and a wicked drop shot. Also, he always had a good joke to tell and enjoyed making others laugh. He will be greatly missed. A celebration of his life will be held at a later date. 1/3\n",

As chairman of Lutheran Medical Center and Augustana Center from 1966 until 2004, Smith, who died Thursday at age 85, left an indelible legacy on southwest Brooklyn. With his friend New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the American Lutheran Church, Mr. Smith brokered the 1977 expansion and relocation of Lutheran Medical Center from 4th Avenue and 46th Street to its present location, a former warehouse at 55th Street and 2nd Avenue in Sunset Park. He facilitated the creation of the Sunset Park Family Health Center, now called NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers, the second largest federally qualified health center network in the nation. He created a lasting financial foundation for Lutheran through Health Plus, an innovative government-sponsored insurance program for low-income residents. Lutheran's sale of Health Plus to Amerigroup in 2011 created an endowment that continues to help modernize the health system. Mr. Smith, a lifelong Brooklyn resident, was chairman emeritus of the United Hospital Fund, former president of the Brooklyn Public Library Board of Trustees, and past vice president and director of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Smith received a bachelor's in chemical engineering from Princeton University and served in the U.S. Army. He served 40 years as president of Virginia Dare Extract Company, which was founded by his grandfather Bernard, and was a former director of Dime Savings Bank of New York before it merged with Washington Mutual in 2002. He is predeceased by his wife, Elsie, and survived by his three children, Howard Jr., Jean, and Lilla, and grandchildren. NYU Lutheran mourns as we celebrate Mr. Smith's life and legacy. A wake will be held at Clavin Funeral Home, 7722 4th Ave., Brooklyn, on Tuesday, February 2, at 4-8pm.

A classic \"New Yorker,\" in every sense of the word, Christina was a native of the Upper West Side for over 50 years. She was an avid Riverside Park gardener, a frequent face at Fairway, and knew every sidewalk crack and crevasse of the Upper West Side. The daughter of Vera Federoff, of Ryazan, Russia, and Bertrand J. Laney, of New York City, Christina was born in Hankow, China, on December 28, 1932, her family fleeing China in 1940, shortly after the Japanese offensive. A true explorer, Christina traveled the world with her family, attending schools in China, Panama, El Salvador, and finally, at the University of Texas, and at New York University. It was in 1953, that Christina, in her own words, \"found her Nirvana\"-New York City. For over 30 years, she was involved in the entertainment industry, acting in small movie and television roles, then working behind the scenes in public relations, advertising, and film production. At United Artists, Christina was the Assistant to the Director of Special Projects for six years. She also worked for the Writer's Guild. Christina was a Vice President of Women of the Motion Picture Industry, and won their Dottie Reeves Humanitarian Award for Community Service. Christina's hobbies were manifold. Her diminutive size and powerhouse personality made her a natural spelunker. She was a member of the National Speleological Society for many years. A talented artist and poet in her own right, Christina supported Women in Motion Pictures, and the Curtain Club. She championed dozens of causes including: The Humane Society, The New York Historical Society, Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society, World Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy, and the ASPCA. Christina was a lifelong volunteer for groups such as Channel 13, The Girl Scout Council of Greater New York, and, for 50 years, the Riverside Park Conservancy, where she was honored for her volunteer contribution in her beloved garden on 78th Street and Riverside Drive. Before there was Google, there was Christina. A voracious reader and a fount of knowledge about a myriad of subjects, especially New York City, family and friends could always rely on Christina for an irrefutable answer. Into her 80s, Christina was a brilliant, plucky, feisty spitfire who continued to stimulate her mind by regular attendance at jazz concerts, museums, art galleries, and theater. She was a devoted sister, aunt, cousin, and friend-a tiny woman with a huge spirit, who will be deeply missed. Christina is survived by her older sister, Kera Toline Rogers of Charleston, SC; niece Catherine Anna Toline, husband Leo Lentsch; nephews, John Colin Toline, and son John, Mark Anderson Toline, wife Ann, and son North, and Paul Alexander Toline; and cousins, Barbara Laney Swenson of Hanover, New Hampshire, Ainslie Drummond of Florida, and Irene Morgan Kay of Australia. Christina's ashes will be interred in Moline, Illinois, with her parents and Russian grandmother, Barbara (Babi) Federoff. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in memory of Christina B.

In the past he has played in world championships for his native Pakistan, and twice led his team to the final of the Bermuda Bowl, but now he was representing the United States for the first time. He and his teammates, Seymon Deutsch, Michael Rosenberg, Paul Soloway, Chip Martel and Lew Stansby, were eliminated in the semifinal, but they made an elegant fashion statement. As a tribute to Zia, they appeared one day in long white Pakistani robes. This proved difficult for Martel, who is the smallest member of the team and had been supplied with an extralarge robe. Whether to shrink the robe or enlarge Martel was the problem, and the former proved simpler.\n",

      "A few hours after the Mets released Mike Torrez, their oldest pitcher, Dwight Gooden, their youngest one, threw seven efficient innings to win his sixth game of the season as the Mets defeated the St. Louis Cardinals, 4-1, at Busch Stadium tonight. The victory was their fourth straight and the 11th in 13 games for the Mets, who maintained a half- game lead over the Phillies and opened a game and a half lead over the Cubs in the National League East. Before the game, the Mets designated Torrez for reassignment, in effect dropping the right-handed pitcher from the roster. The Mets acquired Bruce Berenyi from the Reds Friday, and Torrez became expendable. Gooden, the 19-year-old fastball artist, struck out three batters and faced only 29 before giving way to Jesse Orosco with two out in the eighth. Orosco finished the game for his 13th save.\n",

      "The St. Louis Cardinals snapped their seven-game losing streak tonight when they overpowered the Mets, 9-3, and sent Mike Torrez to his 17th defeat of the season. They won it behind the five-hit pitching of John Stuper, who also knocked in two runs with two singles. But the Cardinals, the defending champions of baseball, remained in fourth place in the National League's East, seven and a half games behind first-place Philadelphia with only 10 games to play. ''A week ago, we were only a game and a half out,'' said Whitey Herzog, the manager of the Cardinals. ''Everybody was saying we had the edge because we played our last 11 games at home. But remember what I kept saying: That, unless we played good ball in those seven final road games, the 11 at home didn't matter. And we lost all seven.''\n",

      "As Peggy Olson, the secretary turned junior copywriter at Sterling Cooper, the fictional 1960s Madison Avenue ad agency at the heart of ''Mad Men'' on AMC, Elisabeth Moss brings a full steno pad of subtleties to a young woman whose ambitions seem essentially futuristic. With her tentative movements, scrappy bangs and hard expressions, she gives us both striver and naïf, a woman blind to how much she yearns for until she lands in a Manhattan of fur-trimmed coats. Peggy embodies the show's mood of gritty postwar aspiration even more than her boss, Don Draper (Jon Hamm), who has climbed so high and so fast that he is suffering from his own kind of altitude sickness. What he ends up wanting, no Diners Club card can purchase. Watching Ms. Moss, feeling her fastidiously counting the miles between the Brooklyn of Peggy's upbringing and the Manhattan of Bonwit Teller, liberal sex and reinvention, you almost hurt. She does something close to somatizing Peggy's class anxieties, and the viewer can't help reaching for the aspirin.\n",

      "THE name on the door says ''Sterling Cooper,'' but the real star of the show is New York City, home to many of the Mad Men and to the advertising agency that keeps them in booze, cigarettes and first-aid kits in case of foot amputations. While ''Law & Order'' has made a franchise of fictionalizing plots ripped from contemporary headlines, ''Mad Men'' uses historical news events as props to drive the running soap opera among its characters. Last year, the hopelessly ladder-climbing Pete Campbell exploited his father's death in the March 1, 1962, American Airlines crash in Jamaica Bay to try to bring the airline in as a client. This season, the agency's wooing of the crew building the new Madison Square Garden becomes a showcase for Don Draper's creative genius. ''New York City is in decay,'' he intones. ''Madison Square Garden -- it's the beginning of a new city on a hill.'' The creator of ''Mad Men,'' Matthew Weiner, is well known for being fastidious about period detail -- from the lingo and popular drinks to determining whether a guest at the wedding of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and Margaretta Murphy (known as Happy) would have been able to drive to the Sterlings' country club party later that day. So, too, with bringing actual news stories to the screen. For the Madison Square Garden episode, he dug up old ''Save Penn Station'' fliers, though the most striking -- ''Rape on 34th St'' -- was his own creation.\n",

Days and nights they weren't working at the oil refinery or the chemical plant and could get away from their wives, they gathered at the American Legion Hall or in the back room at the local bait shop to play dominoes and tell and retell stories.

      "The double bill of Squeeze and the Candy Skins, Wednesday and Thursday at the Beacon Theater, could have been a Beatles fan club meeting. Both bands clearly idolize the Beatles' ability to wrap an effortless melody around unexpected chords and lyrics that acknowledge the complexities of relationships; both have studied and borrowed the Beatles' own chord progressions. Squeeze, however, wants to push things further. Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, Squeeze's songwriters, have a puzzle-maker's approach to pop. On the surface, the band follows the Beatles model; Mr. Tilbrook sings like a lighter-voiced Paul McCartney in tunes that chug along like 1960's pop-rock, with occasional excursions into rockabilly or quasi-country. Their unannounced project is to write songs that make unlikely chords and tunes cohere, with lyrics that intelligently anatomize romance, while sidestepping ordinary structures (like a song with verses and a bridge but no chorus), but that sound catchy anyway. Sometimes they go so far that the songs lose their pop veneer and start to ramble, but after 17 years as a band, Squeeze has learned when to hold back. And when it does indulge itself, it can always fall back on its hits.\n",

Unlike Truffaut's hard-edged romantic drama, a fictional tale about the last, fatal liaison of a philandering literary celebrity, the new film, based on a true story, contains no characters who would have had any claim to fame except for the events that ended their story. On July 13, 1955, Ruth Ellis, the former hostess of a rather sleazy late-night London establishment called the Little Club, and the mother of two young children, one of whom was born out of wedlock, was hanged for the murder of David Blakely, her young, somewhat better-born lover. Though Blakely had some notoriety as an automobile racer, it was still the kind of case, according to Shelagh Delaney, who wrote the screenplay, that newspapers headlined ''Blonde Shoots Man in Hampstead.'' Ruth Ellis has gone into the archives not for what she did but for what the state did to her. She was the last woman in Britain to be sent to the gallows.\n",

      "FLOOD--Charles Andrew, 77, died at his home in New York City on December 23 with his adored wife Kristin by his side. Born in New York City, Charlie was a graduate of Riverdale Country Day School and Amherst College. He spent his early investment career at M.A. Shapiro, New Court Securities, and E.M. Warburg Pincus. For the past 32 years, Charlie and Kristin were business partners of Flood Gamble Associates, an investment management firm. Recently, Flood Gamble joined American Capital Management. Charlie was a dedicated and scrupulously honest businessperson who brought his deep intelligence to his tireless work for his clients. He enjoyed getting to know people of all backgrounds and loved nothing more than the everyday banter he had with friends, clients, neighbors, and everyone he encountered. He had a unique sense of humor and enjoyed gently ribbing people. His weekends were spent gardening and doing chores-Charlie's way of relaxing-in their second home and beloved community of Hudson, New York. Charlie loved the Hudson Valley and, with Kristin, was dedicated to the protection of the Hudson River and its environs. A lifelong Democrat and avid Obama supporter, Charlie enjoyed talking politics and railing against what he felt were the wrongs in society. He also contributed to many social causes. Charlie learned guitar as an adult and his playing and singing were an integral part of his time spent with family. A much-loved spouse, father, and grandfather, Charlie will be greatly missed by his wife of 40 years, Kristin Gamble, his daughters Deborah Flood and Karen Flood, his son-in-law Michael Benedek, and his grandchildren Naomi, Oscar and Violet. A celebration of Charlie will be held at 4:30pm on January 7 at the Metropolitan Club at 1 East 60th Street in New York City.

      "FLOOD--Charles Andrew, 77, died at his home in New York City on December 23 with his adored wife Kristin by his side. Born in New York City, Charlie was a graduate of Riverdale Country Day School and Amherst College. He spent his early investment career at M.A. Shapiro, New Court Securities, and E.M. Warburg Pincus. For the past 32 years, Charlie and Kristin were business partners of Flood Gamble Associates, an investment management firm. Recently, Flood Gamble joined American Capital Management. Charlie was a dedicated and scrupulously honest businessperson who brought his deep intelligence to his tireless work for his clients. He enjoyed getting to know people of all backgrounds and loved nothing more than the everyday banter he had with friends, clients, neighbors, and everyone he encountered. He had a unique sense of humor and enjoyed gently ribbing people. His weekends were spent gardening and doing chores-Charlie's way of relaxing-in their second home and beloved community of Hudson, New York. Charlie loved the Hudson Valley and, with Kristin, was dedicated to the protection of the Hudson River and its environs. A lifelong Democrat and avid Obama supporter, Charlie enjoyed talking politics and railing against what he felt were the wrongs in society. He also contributed to many social causes. Charlie learned guitar as an adult and his playing and singing were an integral part of his time spent with family. A much-loved spouse, father, and grandfather, Charlie will be greatly missed by his wife of 40 years, Kristin Gamble, his daughters Deborah Flood and Karen Flood, his son-in-law Michael Benedek, and his grandchildren Naomi, Oscar and Violet. A celebration of Charlie will be held at 4:30pm on January 7 at the Metropolitan Club at 1 East 60th Street in New York City.

      "HARTE--Judith Shereff, of Livingston, NJ, passed away in New York City on Wednesday, December 30, 2015 after a long and courageous fight with lung cancer. She was 77. Judi was an amazing mother, grandmother, sister, and woman. She enjoyed gardening, reading, painting, sculpting, music and building and fixing things. For a small person, Judi had a huge heart and always opened up her home and her heart to help others. After Hurricane Sandy, she had many displaced people stay with her for extended periods of time and never felt like it was too much; instead, she always said that she wished they would stay longer since she really enjoyed being with them and helping them. Judi was born to Abraham and Rose Shereff on June 18, 1938 in New York City and raised in Forest Hills, NY. She was preceded in death by her parents. Judi is survived by her brother and sister-in-law Richard and Susan Shereff; daughter Helaine Harte and son-in-law David Rhode, her sons and daughters-in-law Douglas and Ronni Harte and Jonathan and Belynda Harte; and the pride of her life, her grandchildren, Alex and Haleigh Harte and Tyler, Casey and Rebecca Rhode. Judi loved all animals. After being a teacher and raising her children, she worked at Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange, NJ, and spent many years rescuing and rehabilitating injured and orphaned wild animals and birds. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to The Turtle Back Zoo in Judi's honor. Funeral service will be held at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel at 630 Amsterdam Avenue in New York City at 11:30am on Sunday, January 3rd. 1/3\n",

Revered and respected throughout the world, we will be forever grateful for his generosity, for the works he gave so enthusiastically to our Foundation, and for his commitment to FAPE's mission. From a sketch on a paper napkin came the design of two magnificent wall sculptures for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which greet more than 2,000 Chinese visa applicants daily, employing the colors in our two countries' flags to honor the relationship between the U.S. and China. In Berlin, Ellsworth watched as the 40- foot-high 'Berlin Totem' he created for the U.S. Embassy soared through the air to be placed in its courtyard garden. His extraordinary lithograph, 'Leaves,' adorns the walls of 50 U.S. embassies; and he contributed to our Collection at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, as well as our millennium Gift To The Nation. He also donated the actual award that we present annually to the recipient of the Leonore and Walter Annenberg Award for Diplomacy through the Arts; the first honoree was Justice Stephen Breyer, who collaborated with Ellsworth on his site- specific installation at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in Boston. Ellsworth's last gift to FAPE was the establishment of an endowment, entitled the Ellsworth Kelly Fund for Preservation, to ensure FAPE's Collection is maintained in perpetuity at no cost to the government. Words cannot express how important Ellsworth was to FAPE. His gifts are a testament to his creativity, his genius and his extraordinary spirit. He will always remain in our memory, and his work will remind us of his belief in the importance of art as a means of freedom of expression and cross-cultural understanding. We send our deepest condolences to Jack Shear.

He said: \"In my paintings, I am not inventing; my ideas come from constantly investigating how things look.\" They included the shadows of an arch of a bridge on the Seine (\"White Plaque: Bridge Arch and Reflection,\" 1951-55); the external chimneys on the wall of a building (\"Ormesson,\" 1950); and the long angular windows at The Museum of Modern Art, Paris (\"Window,\" his first panel painting, 1949).

      "KAPLAN--Gilbert. The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the passing of our dear friend and colleague Gilbert Kaplan, passionate music lover and devoted and beloved husband of Lena. Gil joined the Carnegie Hall Board of Trustees in 1980, and served the Hall with devotion for more than thirty-five years. Gil brought his financial acumen and keen insight to Carnegie Hall's management as a longstanding member of the Finance and Operations Committee, where he helped govern major institutional advances from the restoration of Carnegie Hall to the creation of an education center. Following his successful career in business and journalism, Gil became a celebrated scholar of Gustav Mahler, establishing the Kaplan Foundation and conducting Mahler's Second Symphony with leading orchestras around the world. Gil was invited by the Vienna Philharmonic to conduct the original version of Mahler's Second Symphony and his recordings of the Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic were very successful. Gil demonstrated his deep love and knowledge of music every season as a frequent concertgoer, and many members of the Carnegie Hall's family were honored to be guests on Gil's acclaimed radio program \"Mad About Music.\" We will always remember Gil for his warmth, musical scholarship, and his love of Carnegie Hall. We express our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Lena; his devoted children Kristina, Claude, John, and Emily; and their families and loved ones. Sanford I.

      "KAPLAN--Gilbert, died peacefully on the morning of January 1, 2016, with Lena, his wife of 45 years, and their four loving children by his side. An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it \"wrapped itself around me and never let go.\" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard. His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren. All grieve profoundly at his passing, but feel deeply blessed to have loved and been loved by this remarkable man. The family will receive friends at the Frank E.

She is survived by her children, Anne Davis and Peter (both widowed), grandchildren Ariel Morvan, David and Zoe, and three great-grandchildren, Eleanor, Angelica and Benjamin. Adele studied dramatic arts at NYU, acted briefly, and was passionate about music, art and travel.

      "TRYFOROS--Nicholas James, July 27, 1923-December 31, 2015. Nicholas James Tryforos, son of James and Garufa, was the youngest and last survivor of thirteen children. In explaining why \"Mama and Papa had thirteen children, not twelve or fourteen\" Nick said, \"When I was born, papa picked me up, checked me out, and said 'Mama! FINALLY a perfect baby.'\" A lifelong New Yorker, he was a proud graduate of The Greek American Institute, Theodore Roosevelt High School and New York University. He served in the Army in WWII. After basic training, the Army sent him to language school to become a Hindustani interpreter. He received horse cavalry and military intelligence training, and then served in the Philippines and in General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo during the occupation of Japan. Nick used his Hindustani skills for the rest of his life to surprise and delight both friends and complete strangers from India. After returning from Japan Nick worked for 15 years in the family flower and novelty business, then had a 25-year career with the IRS, retiring in 1986 as a Group Manager, supervising large corporation tax audits. Amateur gymnast, superb photographer, family documenter and archivist, Nick was the favorite uncle of many and worked hard to make and cultivate relationships with family and friends. He collected any piece of junk that could potentially serve a future purpose, taught his children the value of a dollar and the importance of grunt labor, and was the original tiger mom and DIY guy. He was the resident teaser (while being wheeled to major surgery with four children at home, Nick whispered to his wife \"don't worry dear, as long as we have our health!\") and an inveterate joke teller (\"Have you heard the one about the skeleton that walked into a bar...\"). Nick delighted in meeting his children's friends, showing them photos related (and unrelated!) to their discussion, and always enjoyed giving them another tour of the garage! Nick was quietly proud of everyone in his family, and his family was very fortunate to have him. He leaves behind his dear wife of 63 years and best friend Mary, and his children, Margaret and her husband Paul, Jim and his wife Sue, Tom, and Tina and her husband David. He also leaves his grandchildren, Peter, Evan, Kate and her husband Pat, John, Lucas, Eva, and Eli, and great-grandson Theo. Within minutes of Nick's passing, his second great-grandson, Grant, was born. Visitation will be held from 6 to 9pm Monday, January 4th at Frederick Funeral Home in Flushing, and funeral services at 11:30am Tuesday at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in Flushing.

      "BOESCHENSTEIN--Josephine Moll, \"Molly.\" October 29, 1930-December 30, 2015. Josephine Moll \"Molly\" Boeschenstein passed away peacefully Wednesday, December 30, 2015, in Hobe Sound, FL. Molly was born Josephine Hamlin Moll on October 29, 1930, in Detroit, MI, to Josephine Hamlin and The Honorable Lester Moll, a prominent Detroit prosecutor and judge. She grew up in Grosse Pointe, MI. In 1953, she married William W. Boeschenstein, who was working for Owens Corning in Detroit. The couple later moved to Perrysburg, Ohio, where they raised four sons. Mr. Boeschenstein ultimately became Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Owens Corning in Toledo, Ohio. Although her husband became the public face of the company, Molly was a genuine partner to him throughout his career. Molly was known for her intelligence, style, love of competition, and her outstanding, irreverent sense of humor. Conversations with her were punctuated by astute observations, humorous ripostes, and often times belly shaking laughter. She had a wide and deep circle of friends from every corner of her life. Molly was deeply involved in a number of civic and charitable organizations. Notably, she was the first President of the St. Vincent Medical Center Foundation in Toledo, OH, a committed volunteer at the Toledo Museum of Art, and a member of the Board of Directors of The National Council on Alcoholism and Addiction and The Freedom Institute in New York. Molly and her husband have made their principal residence in Hobe Sound, FL. She is survived by her husband of 62 years, William W. Boeschenstein, sons William Jr., Michael, Peter and Stephen, their spouses, and 10 grandchildren and one great- grandchild. Funeral services are pending. Memorial contributions may be made to the Toledo Museum of Art, the Jupiter Medical Center Foundation in Jupiter, FL or the Martin Health Foundation in Stuart, FL. 1/3\n",

An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it \"wrapped itself around me and never let go.\" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard. His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren. All grieve profoundly at his passing, but feel deeply blessed to have loved and been loved by this remarkable man. The family will receive friends at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue (at 81st Street) in New York City, on Thursday, January 7 at 2-5pm and 7-9pm.

He was five days short of his 93rd birthday. Eddie lived a unique and exceptional life. As a young man, Eddie fought bravely in World War II and received a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star. He had many achievements. He was a competitive springboard diver and in 1942 made the U.S. Open at Forest Hills; he had a world-renowned stamp collection and gave generously to many causes in Santa Fe.

By 2010, when New York-based Rosemont Real Estate acquired part ownership of BGK, Gilbert's company was the largest holder of commercial real estate in New Mexico, owning properties in 28 states.

For many, he was the lanky, redheaded and perennially boyish fashion and style reporter for The New York Times, Harper's Bazaar, Esquire and Golf. For others, he was an inspirational practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism: he brought comfort, joy and wisdom to many through his example, his guidance and his two books, \"The Buddha in Your Mirror\" and \"The Buddha in Your Rearview Mirror.\" In Sharon, CT, where he had lived since 1993, he was known as a quirky character with memorable pickup trucks (his beautiful golden retriever, Lola, nearly always along for the ride) and a passion for swimming, biking and otherwise enjoying the beauty around him. For his daughter, Kate, he was her biggest cheerleader as well as the person who always encouraged her to set a high standard and then meet it. He adored her, and she adored him. A true journalist, Woody was interested in everything; for the past few years, he was able to travel widely and meet interesting people in the company of his girlfriend, Kirsten Jensen. His daughter and former wife, Cynthia, were glad that he was able to enrich his life and expand his horizons with Kirsten before his death, from a glioblastoma tumor, on December 31.

Memorial Service Friday, January 8th, 12:00pm, Short Hills Community Congregational Church. Luncheon Friday, January 8th, after the service, Short Hills Club, 144 Highland Avenue. James C. Kellogg, philanthropist and loving husband, father of three children, and grandfather of nine grandchildren, died on Thursday of congestive heart failure, surrounded by his family. He was 76 years old. Jim was a graduate of The Pingry School, Princeton University, and Harvard Law School. During his career, he was a partner at the Manhattan law firm Townley & Updike, the President of the Community Foundation of New Jersey, the President of the J.C. Kellogg Foundation, and a valued trustee of many non-profit boards. He was most proud of his philanthropic work in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He cherished the idea of creating opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds to be healthy, learn, and grow. Jim grew up in Elizabeth, NJ and spent his summers in Bay Head, NJ, where he made many friends whom he kept throughout his life. Those friends would gather on a regular basis for couples' dinners and bridge marathons. He looked forward to Romeo lunches, Scorpions bridge, and the Literatti book club, where he always touted the latest political book. In the past few years, Jim became a Life Master at bridge by participating in ACBL bridge tournaments across the country. He spent his winters at Yeamans Hall in South Carolina. Jim had a deep commitment to public service; he advised and served on the boards of Frost Valley YMCA, Bay Head Chapel, Short Hills Community Congregational Church, Point Pleasant Hospital, the Children's Specialized Hospital, Trinitas Regional Medical Center, Meridian Health Systems, Council of Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, Union County College, Bloomfield College, the Prudential Insurance Company, New Jersey State in the Trust for Public Lands, and the Scholarship Fund for Inner City Children. He was appointed by the Governor to the boards of New Jersey Transit and the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. His lifelong passion for philanthropy paled in comparison to his love for his family- his wife, three children, and nine grandchildren. Jim was happiest at family gatherings and loved playing backgammon and gin rummy with his children and grandchildren. Pop Pop's signature backgammon move was to wait for his opponent to admit defeat only to turn the board around and play the losing side, teaching his mentee how to stage a comeback and win! He was active in every aspect of his children's and grandchildren's lives, including attending their school events, and offering advice on and help with work issues. He is survived by his wife, Gail Chambers Kellogg, his children, Jimmy Kellogg, Kate Kellogg, and Elizabeth Kellogg Winterbottom; adoring grandchildren, Emily, Jimmy and Grace Kellogg; Chris and Andrew Kellogg Peeler; Hailey, Francesca, Maile, and Penelope Winterbottom; and his three younger brothers, Peter, Kelly, and Rusty. A service to celebrate his life will be held Friday, January 8th at 12:00pm at the Short Hills Community Congregational Church. Immediately following the service, the family invites all attendees to join them for lunch at the Short Hills Club. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Frost Valley YMCA in Claryville, NY. For more info, or to send condolences to the family, please visit www.bradleyfuneral homes.com. 1/3\n",

Under Eddie's leadership the company acquired a large national portfolio as well as premier buildings in New Mexico, Texas and elsewhere. By 2010, when New York-based Rosemont Real Estate acquired part ownership of BGK, Gilbert's company was the largest holder of commercial real estate in New Mexico, owning properties in 28 states. He was \"larger than life\" say his children. He will be greatly missed. He is survived by his wife Peaches, seven children, Robin, Alexandra (Ronald), Dominique, Nina, Sasha, Beatrice and Zoe and three grandchildren, Brooke, Ross and Yeabsira. 1/3\n",

An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it \"wrapped itself around me and never let go.\" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard. His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren. All grieve profoundly at his passing, but feel deeply blessed to have loved and been loved by this remarkable man. The family will receive friends at the Frank E.

      "BOULEZ--Pierre. The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall celebrate the life of our dear friend and colleague Pierre Boulez, one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th century. A legendary composer, conductor, musical philosopher and activist, Pierre Boulez was a visionary and trailblazing global force for modern music. Carnegie Hall was privileged to elect him an Honorary Trustee in 1995, and to appoint him as the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair from 1999 to 2003. Boulez made approximately 75 appearances at Carnegie Hall, conducting close to 60 performances on our stages, and his works have been performed on more than 80 programs. As an arts educator, he was inspirational-challenging audiences to explore a new aesthetic of music through his musical research center IRCAM, and, in the course of the Professional Training Workshops he led through Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute, offering profound insights to young musicians. Boulez's work in Paris served as an inspiration in the conception of Zankel Hall, the opening season of which included performances by Boulez with the Ensemble Intercontemporain. Pierre Boulez will be deeply missed by all of us at Carnegie Hall and by the entire artistic community, though his brilliant musical legacy and pioneering spirit will stay with us all. We express heartfelt condolences to his sister, Jeanne Chevalier Boulez, and brother, Roger Boulez, as well as their many children and grandchildren. Sanford I. Weill, President; Mercedes T.

      "KAPLAN--Gilbert, died peacefully on the morning of January 1, 2016, with Lena, his wife of 45 years, and their four loving children by his side. An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it \"wrapped itself around me and never let go.\" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard. His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren. All grieve profoundly at his passing, but feel deeply blessed to have loved and been loved by this remarkable man. The family will receive friends at the Frank E.

      "BOULEZ--Pierre. The New York Philharmonic deeply mourns the passing of Pierre Boulez, our bold and innovative Music Director from 1971 to 1977 as well as a trailblazing composer and thinker. Under Boulez, the Philharmonic introduced concert formats that brought the audience in direct contact with composers and performers, including the informal Rug Concerts and downtown Prospective Encounters. He returned in 1986 for a 14- event series highlighting his work as conductor, composer, and leader of the Ensemble Intercontemporain. In 1992 he celebrated the Philharmonic's 150th anniversary in a concert also led by former Music Directors Zubin Mehta and Kurt Masur. In the same year Boulez was made an Honorary Member of the Society, an honor shared by such figures as Wagner, Stravinsky, and Bernstein. New York Philharmonic Music Director Alan Gilbert said: \"Pierre Boulez was a towering and influential musical figure whose Philharmonic leadership implicitly laid down a challenge of innovation and invention that continues to inspire us to this day. To me, personally, he also was an unfailingly gracious mentor and friend, from the years when I worked with him in Cleveland and when I was appointed to the Philharmonic to the last time I saw him in Baden- Baden on a Philharmonic tour. I will miss his musicianship, kindness, and wisdom.\" The New York Philharmonic family sends our love and compassion to his family. 1/3\n",

      "KAISER--Walter, May 31, 1931 to January 5, 2016. Born in Bellevue, Ohio during the Depression, the son of a grocer, he became a page in the U.S. Senate in 1944 and then won scholarships to Philips Academy, Andover and Harvard, an institution he didn't leave until retirement. He graduated magna cum laude with highest honors in 1954, received his Ph.D. in 1960, and was made Professor of English and Comparative Literature in 1969. From 1988 to 2002 he served as Director of Villa I Tatti, the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies in Florence. His leadership profoundly shaped I Tatti, and those were among his happiest years; he always felt that he truly belonged to the northern Mediterranean, especially to Greece and Italy. His love of learning and the arts gave color and depth to every aspect of his life. Few people have been more learned or more cultivated, wittier or more awake to beauty. Fewer still have had his genius for friendship. He was extraordinarily generous with his attention, and always finding opportunities for generosity where others wouldn't have seen them. He was the best of fathers. He is survived by his children, Miranda and David, and three granddaughters; by his brother, Bob; by his many godchildren; and by hundreds of others whose lives he enriched immeasurably, as the astonishing outpouring of grief and love from around the world since his death attests. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Walter Kaiser Fund for the Biblioteca Berenson at Villa I Tatti, Harvard University. 1/3\n",

Before joining our New York appellate litigation and arbitration practice in 2009, Judith spent 25 years on the bench of the New York Court of Appeals, including the last 15 as its Chief Judge. The first woman to serve on New York's highest court, Judith earned a national reputation for her pioneering opinions and court reforms. She wrote seminal opinions on such issues as the death penalty, same-sex marriage, education and state constitutional rights while leading innovative changes to the New York court system, including the establishment of specialized courts to focus on issues of drug addiction, domestic violence and mental health. As Chief Judge, Judith created the Adoption Now program, helped establish the Center for Court Innovation and co-chaired the ABA Commission on the American Jury. She retired from the bench in 2008, having served longer than any Chief Judge in state history. At Skadden, Judith helped numerous clients navigate complex issues of New York law. She also served as a trustee of the Skadden Fellowship Foundation and continued her advocacy for families and children, including through her service as the chairwoman of the Permanent Judicial Commission on Justice for Children. Judith graduated from Barnard College ('58) and NYU School of Law ('62), where she was one of 10 women in a class of nearly 300. Judith is survived by her children, Luisa, Jonathan and Gordon, and seven grandchildren. She will be greatly missed. 1/3\n",

      "BOULEZ--Pierre. The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall celebrate the life of our dear friend and colleague Pierre Boulez, one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th century. A legendary composer, conductor, musical philosopher and activist, Pierre Boulez was a visionary and trailblazing global force for modern music. Carnegie Hall was privileged to elect him an Honorary Trustee in 1995, and to appoint him as the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair from 1999 to 2003. Boulez made approximately 75 appearances at Carnegie Hall, conducting close to 60 performances on our stages, and his works have been performed on more than 80 programs. As an arts educator, he was inspirational-challenging audiences to explore a new aesthetic of music through his musical research center IRCAM, and, in the course of the Professional Training Workshops he led through Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute, offering profound insights to young musicians. Boulez's work in Paris served as an inspiration in the conception of Zankel Hall, the opening season of which included performances by Boulez with the Ensemble Intercontemporain. Pierre Boulez will be deeply missed by all of us at Carnegie Hall and by the entire artistic community, though his brilliant musical legacy and pioneering spirit will stay with us all. We express heartfelt condolences to his sister, Jeanne Chevalier Boulez, and brother, Roger Boulez, as well as their many children and grandchildren. Sanford I. Weill, President; Mercedes T.

      "KAYE--Judith. January 7. The partners, attorneys and staff of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP mourn the passing of our colleague and friend Judith Kaye. Before joining our New York appellate litigation and arbitration practice in 2009, Judith spent 25 years on the bench of the New York Court of Appeals, including the last 15 as its Chief Judge. The first woman to serve on New York's highest court, Judith earned a national reputation for her pioneering opinions and court reforms. She wrote seminal opinions on such issues as the death penalty, same-sex marriage, education and state constitutional rights while leading innovative changes to the New York court system, including the establishment of specialized courts to focus on issues of drug addiction, domestic violence and mental health. As Chief Judge, Judith created the Adoption Now program, helped establish the Center for Court Innovation and co-chaired the ABA Commission on the American Jury. She retired from the bench in 2008, having served longer than any Chief Judge in state history. At Skadden, Judith helped numerous clients navigate complex issues of New York law. She also served as a trustee of the Skadden Fellowship Foundation and continued her advocacy for families and children, including through her service as the chairwoman of the Permanent Judicial Commission on Justice for Children. Judith graduated from Barnard College ('58) and NYU School of Law ('62), where she was one of 10 women in a class of nearly 300. Judith is survived by her children, Luisa, Jonathan and Gordon, and seven grandchildren. She will be greatly missed. Funeral services will be held at 10:00am (doors open at 9:15), Monday, January 11, at the David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center. 1/3\n",

She was a great friend of Fordham Law School and its alumni, particularly those serving in the state and federal judiciary. Over the years, she wrote for the Fordham Law Review and other journals, and she inspired students, graduates, and alumni with her remarks at the school's diploma ceremony, conferences, and lecture series. The school honored her in 2002 with the Fordham- Stein Prize, which is presented annually to a member of the legal profession whose work embodies the highest standards of the legal profession. In 2012, she participated in a special conversation alongside retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor that canvassed their concerns about the election of judges, the importance of civic education and involvement for lawyers, and their pathbreaking appointments as the first women to hold their respective judicial roles. In addition to her jurisprudence, her administrative impact will leave an indelible mark on the office of Chief Judge of the State of New York.

For others, he was an inspirational practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism: he brought comfort, joy and wisdom to many through his example, his guidance and his two books, \"The Buddha in Your Mirror\" and \"The Buddha in Your Rearview Mirror.\" In Sharon, CT, where he had lived since 1993, he was known as a quirky character with memorable pickup trucks (his beautiful golden retriever, Lola, nearly always along for the ride) and a passion for swimming, biking and otherwise enjoying the beauty around him. For his daughter, Kate, he was her biggest cheerleader as well as the person who always encouraged her to set a high standard and then meet it. He adored her, and she adored him. A true journalist, Woody was interested in everything; for the past few years, he was able to travel widely and meet interesting people in the company of his girlfriend, Kirsten Jensen.

(1929-2016), an Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, who made important contributions to the study of higher education, labor markets and industrial sociology, died on January 1, 2016. Dr. Berg's classic book, Education and Jobs: The Great Training Robbery (1970) cast doubt on economists' assertions that people with more education earn more because they are more skilled and productive; instead, employers frequently hire people to work in jobs that do not make use of their education. His book played a major role in a landmark civil rights decision by the U. S. Supreme Court, Griggs vs. Duke Power Company (1971) and was credited with providing the bases of the theory of market signaling, for which Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics. Among his many honors, he was elected a Fellow of the International Academy of Management, which cited him as \"one of the seminal figures in the sociological study of labor markets and the founder of economic sociology.\" Born January 3, 1929 in Brooklyn, NY, he earned his AB at Colgate and his doctorate at Harvard. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps, retiring as a major, and on the faculties of Columbia and Vanderbilt, in addition to Penn. Dr. Berg, author of more than 70 articles and chapters and dozen books, leaves a wife, Sharon (Calli) Berg, a son and daughter-in-law, Geoffrey and Amy Berg, and stepsons Tim Smallwood (and his wife, Staci Smallwood) and Jim Smallwood (and his fiance, Catta Keith). 1/3\n",

We recognize and celebrate that no one has had a more profound, positive impact on our court system. She was New York's first female, and longest serving, Chief Judge, and used her matchless energy and wisdom, heart and soul, to reshape the courts to improve the lives of countless people. She pioneered court innovations based on the premise that the legal system exists to serve the people with fairness and sensitivity. For this she was beloved, nationally and internationally. She neither sought nor basked in the accolades, acknowledging them with a shy smile and a handwritten note combining modesty and gratitude. She could be hilariously funny, but never at anyone else's expense. It is fitting that her memorial service will be held at Lincoln Center as the arts were important in her life, and she could be heard singing in the courthouse corridors. Judith once said she has a 5 to 9 job, arriving at 5am (often with grandmother photos to exchange with maintenance staff) leaving at 9pm, and yet she was always able to be there, undistracted, for her family and friends. Though as a historical society we focus on figures from the past, we were so fortunate to have had one of the nations' leading lights in our midst. She battled her illness with courage and dignity. It seemed to us that the day of her passing would somehow never come. But she was, after all, human. The Historical Society of the New York Courts 1/3\n",

Before joining our New York appellate litigation and arbitration practice in 2009, Judith spent 25 years on the bench of the New York Court of Appeals, including the last 15 as its Chief Judge. The first woman to serve on New York's highest court, Judith earned a national reputation for her pioneering opinions and court reforms. She wrote seminal opinions on such issues as the death penalty, same-sex marriage, education and state constitutional rights while leading innovative changes to the New York court system, including the establishment of specialized courts to focus on issues of drug addiction, domestic violence and mental health. As Chief Judge, Judith created the Adoption Now program, helped establish the Center for Court Innovation and co-chaired the ABA Commission on the American Jury. She retired from the bench in 2008, having served longer than any Chief Judge in state history. At Skadden, Judith helped numerous clients navigate complex issues of New York law. She also served as a trustee of the Skadden Fellowship Foundation and continued her advocacy for families and children, including through her service as the chairwoman of the Permanent Judicial Commission on Justice for Children.

      "PRESENT-- Dr. Daniel H. A brilliant, creative, and abundantly loved giant has left us. Dr. Daniel H. Present, born April 3, 1934, passed away on January 12th from complication of Parkinson's Disease. He was 81 years old. His passing will be deeply mourned by Jane Werner Present, his wife, partner, lover and best friend of more than 59 years, his three children, their spouses, and four grandchildren, Tracy Present, Stephanie, Michael, Billy and Katherine Podalak, Douglas, Susan, Adam and Margot Present, and his sister Judy Present Liss; his friends, associates and the thousands of lives he touched during his 50 years of practice. Dan graduated from Syracuse University Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 and State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, Magna Cum Laude, in 1959. He completed an internship, medical residency, Gastroenterology residency and GI Fellowship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and entered private practice in 1964, where he quickly began to focus his attention on the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He was the recipient of the first research award given by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Dan brought clinical trials into clinical practice. His first paper was accepted for publication in 1966. He subsequently published 329 papers. At the time of his retirement, his publications had been cited more than 15,000 times. During his 54 years at Mt. Sinai, he served as President of both the Association of the Attending Staff and the Alumni Association for which he received the coveted Jacobi Medallion for Conspicuous Service to the Alumni. Dan received every award in his field including the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award, The American Gastroenterology Association Distinguished Clinician Award, Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, The WiIIiam Dock, M.D. Master Teacher Award in Medicine State University of New York, the Janssen Award for Outstanding Achievement Award in Clinical Gastroenterology, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Arents Award for Excellence in Medicine, the highest achievement awarded by Syracuse University. He is generally recognized as having pioneered the way Crohn's disease is treated. More than any recognition, Dan loved taking care of his patients. He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Funeral services will be held on Thursday at 12pm at \"The Riverside,\" 180 West 76th St., New York. Contributions in Dan's memory may be made to the Present-Levison Fellowship at Mt. Sinai, and sent to the Division of Gastroenterology, Mt. Sinai Hospital, Box 1069, New York, New York 10029. 1/3\n",

He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Joanne Kelly Hagopian; his daughter Susan Goddard and sons Thomas and Matthew; nine grandchildren; his sister Helen Geovjian; and more than 40 members of his extended family. Lou thought himself to be one of the luckiest men in the world, with a wife and family who loved him and whom he loved dearly, parents he respected and adored and a career he both enjoyed and succeeded in beyond his wildest hopes. As the son of parents who fled to the United States after their families were killed in the Armenian Genocide, he felt that he truly lived the American Dream and loved this country for it. Lou served in the US Navy during World War II and graduated from Michigan State University after the War. His career started in the auto business, but his skills in marketing and communications soon led him to a successful career in advertising with the oldest agency in the US, NW Ayer. He led NW Ayer for over 25 years, including the last ten as Chairman and CEO. During his tenure, Ayer was selected Agency of the Year and developed numerous iconic advertising campaigns with taglines such as \"A Diamond is Forever\" and \"Be All That You Can Be.\" He also was Chairman of the Advertising Association of America and a founding member of the innovative Partnership for Drug-Free America. Lou was a man of style with an enormous heart, tremendous charm and a wicked wit. He loved to serenade his wife, Joanne, with \"Misty\" or \"My Funny Valentine\" whenever given the slightest excuse (and often without). An avid and excellent golfer for over 70 years, he started as a caddy at the Pine Lake Country Club outside of Detroit and ended as a member of the Royal & Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews (where he won the Seniors Tournament at the age of 86). Services will be held at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in Darien, CT at 10:30am on Saturday, January 16. A memorial service will also be scheduled for friends and relatives in Vero Beach in the next several weeks. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that a memorial donation be made to Indian River Habitat for Humanity, www.irchabitat.org.

He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, then graduated from New York University (1948), Phi Beta Kappa, and entered the graduate program at Harvard (Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, 1954), where he wrote a prize-winning essay on Shakespeare. He spent his entire teaching career at Tufts University (1954-84), serving twice as chair of the Department of English. He published a number of essays in scholarly journals, a popular introduction to Shakespeare, and he served as General Editor of The Signet Classic Shakespeare, a paperback series (one play per volume) that is widely used in colleges and universities. He was also the author or co-author of several widely used textbooks-on argument (with Hugo Bedau, late of the Tufts Department of Philosophy), art, composition, drama, and literature, including \"A Short Guide to Writing about Art\" (now in its 11th edition), and \"Introduction to Literature\" (16th edition). In 1963, he and William Burto (his partner since 1952, deceased 2013) developed an interest in Japanese art, especially calligraphy, and they went on to build a collection that was exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery, the Harvard Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art, Houston. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog by Miyeko Murase, \"The Written Image\" (2002), to which Barnet and Burto contributed two essays, one on collecting, the other on looking at calligraphy from a Western point of view. (After Burto's death their collection was divided among the first four of these museums.) He and Burto also wrote \"Zen Ink Paintings\" (1982) as well as several essays on Japanese art. As a teacher of English literature, he was familiar with a good deal of writing about death. Among the favorite passages he carried in his head-he could not understand why some educators disparage \"rote memory\"-were Shakespeare's \"Golden lads and girls all must/As chimney sweepers come to dust.\" and this epitaph by Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), \"Upon the Death of Sir Albert Morton's Wife\": \"He first deceased; she for a little tried/To live without him, liked it not, and died.\" (Barnet said, shortly after the death of his partner, that Wotton's lines came to his mind every day, and that he regretted, every day, his inability to re-enact them.) He leaves his sister-in-law Saretta Barnet, a niece and three nephews and their spouses, nine grandnephews and nieces, a great-grandnephew and niece, and his longtime friend, Morton Berman. Most of his estate was bequeathed to a scholarship fund at Tufts, in honor of his parents, Philip and Esther Barnet. By his wish there will be no services. 1/3\n",

      "PRESENT--Daniel H.,M.D. We at the Mount Sinai Health System are saddened by the passing of Daniel H. Present, M.D., a beloved physician who, in a five-decade career at Mount Sinai, was at the forefront of research into the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Dr. Present was the first researcher to show the effectiveness of an immunosuppressant, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), in fighting Crohn's disease. When Dr. Present published his results in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 1980, it changed the lives of thousands of Crohn's patients. Later, he studied the use of cyclosporine for severe steroid- refractory ulcerative colitis, and demonstrated that it could help avoid or delay colectomies in many of these seriously ill patients. In a third breakthrough in the late 1990s, Dr. Present studied cA2, also known as infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody, and showed, in another seminal paper in the NEJM, that it could help close fistulas in Crohn's patients. Early in his career at Mount Sinai, he was mentored by Henry D. Janowitz, M.D., for whom the Division of Gastroenterology is named. Dr. Present was also a talented clinician who cared for thousands of patients over his career. Over a decade ago, he and his wife, Jane, established an endowed fellowship at Mount Sinai to train graduates from outside institutions to become experts in the care of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Dr. and Mrs. Present also maintained a foundation for clinical research of IBD. Upon his retirement from Mount Sinai in 2014, the foundation donated its principal in support of The Susan and Leonard Feinstein Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinical Center at Mount Sinai. We extend our deepest sympathies to Jane and their children, Douglas, Stephanie, and Tracy, at this difficult time. Peter W. May, Chairman, Boards of Trustees, Mount Sinai Health System Kenneth L.

      "BARNET--Sylvan, born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 11, 1926, died at home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 9, 2016. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, then graduated from New York University (1948), Phi Beta Kappa, and entered the graduate program at Harvard (Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, 1954), where he wrote a prize-winning essay on Shakespeare. He spent his entire teaching career at Tufts University (1954-84), serving twice as chair of the Department of English. He published a number of essays in scholarly journals, a popular introduction to Shakespeare, and he served as General Editor of The Signet Classic Shakespeare, a paperback series (one play per volume) that is widely used in colleges and universities. He was also the author or co-author of several widely used textbooks-on argument (with Hugo Bedau, late of the Tufts Department of Philosophy), art, composition, drama, and literature, including \"A Short Guide to Writing about Art\" (now in its 11th edition), and \"Introduction to Literature\" (16th edition). In 1963, he and William Burto (his partner since 1952, deceased 2013) developed an interest in Japanese art, especially calligraphy, and they went on to build a collection that was exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery, the Harvard Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art, Houston. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog by Miyeko Murase, \"The Written Image\" (2002), to which Barnet and Burto contributed two essays, one on collecting, the other on looking at calligraphy from a Western point of view. (After Burto's death their collection was divided among the first four of these museums.) He and Burto also wrote \"Zen Ink Paintings\" (1982) as well as several essays on Japanese art. As a teacher of English literature, he was familiar with a good deal of writing about death. Among the favorite passages he carried in his head-he could not understand why some educators disparage \"rote memory\"-were Shakespeare's \"Golden lads and girls all must/As chimney sweepers come to dust.\" and this epitaph by Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), \"Upon the Death of Sir Albert Morton's Wife\": \"He first deceased; she for a little tried/To live without him, liked it not, and died.\" (Barnet said, shortly after the death of his partner, that Wotton's lines came to his mind every day, and that he regretted, every day, his inability to re-enact them.) He leaves his sister-in-law Saretta Barnet, a niece and three nephews and their spouses, nine grandnephews and nieces, a great-grandnephew and niece, and his longtime friend, Morton Berman. Most of his estate was bequeathed to a scholarship fund at Tufts, in honor of his parents, Philip and Esther Barnet. By his wish there will be no services. 1/3\n",

      "PRESENT-- Dr. Daniel H. A brilliant, creative, and abundantly loved giant has left us. Dr. Daniel H. Present, born April 3, 1934, passed away on January 12th from complication of Parkinson's Disease. He was 81 years old. His passing will be deeply mourned by Jane Werner Present, his wife, partner, lover and best friend of more than 59 years, his three children, their spouses, and four grandchildren, Tracy Present, Stephanie, Michael, Billy and Katherine Podalak, Douglas, Susan, Adam and Margot Present, and his sister Judy Present Liss; his friends, associates and the thousands of lives he touched during his 50 years of practice. Dan graduated from Syracuse University Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 and State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, Magna Cum Laude, in 1959. He completed an internship, medical residency, Gastroenterology residency and GI Fellowship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and entered private practice in 1964, where he quickly began to focus his attention on the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He was the recipient of the first research award given by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Dan brought clinical trials into clinical practice. His first paper was accepted for publication in 1966. He subsequently published 329 papers. At the time of his retirement, his publications had been cited more than 15,000 times. During his 54 years at Mt. Sinai, he served as President of both the Association of the Attending Staff and the Alumni Association for which he received the coveted Jacobi Medallion for Conspicuous Service to the Alumni. Dan received every award in his field including the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award, The American Gastroenterology Association Distinguished Clinician Award, Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, The WiIIiam Dock, M.D. Master Teacher Award in Medicine State University of New York, the Janssen Award for Outstanding Achievement Award in Clinical Gastroenterology, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Arents Award for Excellence in Medicine, the highest achievement awarded by Syracuse University. He is generally recognized as having pioneered the way Crohn's disease is treated. More than any recognition, Dan loved taking care of his patients. He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Funeral services will be held on Thursday at 12pm at \"The Riverside,\" 180 West 76th St., New York. Contributions in Dan's memory may be made to the Present-Levison Fellowship at Mt. Sinai, and sent to the Division of Gastroenterology, Mt. Sinai Hospital, Box 1069, New York, New York 10029. 1/3\n",

      "MESSMORE--Mary Anne, of Baltimore, Maryland, died peacefully with her family by her side on January 11, 2016. Mary's life was most remarkable for the effect she had on the people around her. She brought light and laughter to every room she entered. A rock of comfort and support for anyone grieving or feeling lonely, Mary loved to laugh and make others laugh, play games, cook, and spend time with friends. She loved her dogs, the mountains, music, boating, reading, and traveling. But most of all, she loved her husband, John, her son, Ike, and her daughter, Lindsey. For those fortunate enough to have met her, Mary will be remembered as one of the warmest and most thoughtful people the world has known. Generous and welcoming, she opened her home to everyone-friends and strangers alike-who needed a home-cooked meal or a safe haven. She was fiercely loyal to and supportive of those close to her and kind to everyone she met. Mary's family takes comfort in the knowledge that her legacy lives on through the immeasurable impact she had on others. While the joy and laughter that her memories evoke pale in comparison to her radiant physical presence, they ensure that she will never be forgotten. It is Mary's family's hope that all who knew her will honor her memory by striving to treat others with the grace and kindness that she did. It was the size of Mary's heart that made the world a better place. A celebration of Mary's life will be held at 5pm on Saturday, January 23, at Baltimore Country Club at Five Farms, 11500 Mays Chapel Road, Lutherville, MD 21093. All friends are welcome. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary's name to Dyslexia Tutoring Program (dyslexiatutoringprogram.org). As John Irving, one of Mary's favorite authors, once wrote: \"It is hard work and great art to make life not so serious.\" In that respect, Mary was a tireless and masterful artist. 1/3\n",

      "MANUS--Morton. President of Alfred Music, passed away at his Los Angeles home on January 9 after a battle with cancer. He was a devoted husband to his wife Iris, a loving father and grandfather, an innovative music publisher, a celebrated author, an inspiring mentor to his staff, and a dedicated friend. Morty was a great man. Born in 1926 in New York to Russian immigrants Samuel and Ann, Morty proudly enlisted in the Air Force during WWII, received a business degree from The City College of New York, and in the late 1940s, joined his father in the family business, Alfred Music. When Morty started working at Alfred Music, there were four employees: Morty's father Sam, a picker, a packer, and a bookkeeper. The important part of this story is Rose, the bookkeeper, who had a daughter named Iris. Morty and Iris fell in love, and as they say, the rest is history. They were married over 60 years. Alfred Music began in New York's Tin Pan Alley in 1922 and focused on mood music for silent films. Inspired by the need for quality music education products, Morty, a pianist, clarinetist, and guitarist, reinvented the company in the 1950s. He oversaw the development of an instructional series for accordion, followed by similar publications for guitar, piano, and recorder. Morty is the author and editor of hundreds of titles in Alfred Music's catalog, including the enormously popular series, Alfred's Basic Guitar Method and Alfred's Basic Piano Library. When Alfred Music outgrew its New York headquarters in the mid-1970s, Morty and Iris moved the company to Los Angeles. As time went by, they split their time between New York and Los Angeles, having many close friends on both coasts. The company continued to grow under Morty's leadership. Morty was joined in the business by his son Ron in 1988 and his son Steven in 1992. The family business expanded into the world's leading instructional music publisher with offices in Australia, Germany, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. In 2005, Alfred Music purchased Warner Bros. Print Publications. Morty received an honorary Doctorate of Music from VanderCook College of Music in July of 2008. Morty and Iris continued to be deeply committed to music education by supporting many music scholarships, competitions, and organizations. Morty had many hobbies including being an avid sports fan, rooting for the Lakers and Dodgers. He was also a keen investor, skilled at stock charting and analysis. Among Morty's other great accomplishments was climbing Mount Washington, New Hampshire on several occasions. He would often remark to his companions during the climb, \"You will tell your grandchildren about this.\" Though terribly saddened by their loss, the Manus family members are now focusing on celebrating his life and the bright light of his legacy. Thanks to his amazing life's work, generations of music makers will continue to experience the joy of making music. Morty and Iris recently summed up their love for music education and Alfred Music with these words: \"Working a lifetime with Music and Musicians was not always milk and honey, but it was as close to heaven on earth as we could get.\" Morty is survived by his wife Iris; his three sons Steven (wife Sylvie), Scott, and Ron (partner Renee); his three granddaughters Alexandra, Samantha, and Melissandra; and his brother-in-law Jay Kopelman (wife Sherry).

      "de SIMONE--Lillian Imundo. Beloved mother, teacher and friend, passed away peacefully on January 6, 2016, after a long illness. She was at home, surrounded by her three daughters. Her charm, intelligence and wit enriched the lives of all who knew her. Born and raised in the Bronx, NY, she worked in the personnel department at the Revlon company's headquarters, and helped her brother Rico establish the New Dimension Theatre in Oradell, NJ. In the 1970's as a divorced mother of three, she entered Ramapo College, earned her bachelor's degree and then began her long, rewarding career in education. She taught drama, public speaking, English and literature at Emerson High School for 27 years, helping generations of students to find meaning in stories, to make sense of the world and to find their own voices. Beloved by her students, she was voted favorite teacher by more than a dozen senior classes. Over the years, she shared her love of travel and all things Italian with students she led on trips to Italy. She took joy in the rich process of education and was a lifelong learner herself. From the most recent archeological discovery to finding a new jazz standard; from cooking a favorite meal to alerting the family to a special moonrise, her curiosity and enthusiasm was a joy for all around her. She will be remembered for her laugh, her love of life and her fierce courage of the heart. Lillian was the youngest child of Filomena Volino Imundo and Rocco Imundo, and was predeceased by her siblings Ann, Louis, Rose and Rico. She is survived by her daughters Renata Simone of Marblehead, MA, Lauren de Simone and Stephanie Sanders of Ridgewood, NJ, and her granddaughters Lily and Roxanne Sanders. Private observances will be held. Condolences can be sent to lillydesimone@aol.com. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests a donation in memory of Lillian to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation or the charity of your choice. 1/3\n",

      "MESSMORE--Mary Anne, of Baltimore, Maryland, died peacefully with her family by her side on January 11, 2016. Mary's life was most remarkable for the effect she had on the people around her. She brought light and laughter to every room she entered. A rock of comfort and support for anyone grieving or feeling lonely, Mary loved to laugh and make others laugh, play games, cook, and spend time with friends. She loved her dogs, the mountains, music, boating, reading, and traveling. But most of all, she loved her husband, John, her son, Ike, and her daughter, Lindsey. For those fortunate enough to have met her, Mary will be remembered as one of the warmest and most thoughtful people the world has known. Generous and welcoming, she opened her home to everyone-friends and strangers alike-who needed a home-cooked meal or a safe haven. She was fiercely loyal to and supportive of those close to her and kind to everyone she met. Mary's family takes comfort in the knowledge that her legacy lives on through the immeasurable impact she had on others. While the joy and laughter that her memories evoke pale in comparison to her radiant physical presence, they ensure that she will never be forgotten. It is Mary's family's hope that all who knew her will honor her memory by striving to treat others with the grace and kindness that she did. It was the size of Mary's heart that made the world a better place. A celebration of Mary's life will be held at 5pm on Saturday, January 23, at Baltimore Country Club at Five Farms, 11500 Mays Chapel Road, Lutherville, MD 21093. All friends are welcome. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary's name to Dyslexia Tutoring Program (dyslexiatutoringprogram.org). As John Irving, one of Mary's favorite authors, once wrote: \"It is hard work and great art to make life not so serious.\" In that respect, Mary was a tireless and masterful artist. 1/3\n",

      "LIEBER--Constance E. March 2, 1924 - January 15, 2016. Constance Lieber transformed her family's experience with significant mental illness into a life suffused with meaning, purpose, and extraordinary effectiveness. Few people could imagine the breadth and depth of her interests, ranging from the most creative modern art to inspiring architecture, exhilarating music, and insightful studies of neuroscience and human behavior. Guided by her compassion, dedication, and curiosity - as well as her personal relationships with scores of leading psychiatrists and neuroscientists - Constance informally advised thousands of parents who were desperately seeking better treatments and cures for their mentally ill children. During their sixty-five year marriage, Constance and her husband Stephen A. Lieber shared enduring love and intense intellectual insights to transform the field of basic and clinical research into the origins of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Since 1980, Constance and Steve have been among the leading public advocates and philanthropic supporters of schizophrenia and depression research in the US and around the globe. Their efforts included the creation of significant clinical and scientific institutions to support emerging discoveries in the fields of biological psychiatry and patient services. For over twenty-five years, they gave exemplary leadership to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD), the world's largest private funder of mental health research. Constance served as President from 1989 to 2007. In 2014, their activities were honored by the American Psychiatric Association with a Special Presidential Commendation, stating \"Constance and Steve have provided unwavering moral and material support to unravel the mysteries of the brain, and to better understand and treat mental illness.\" In 1987, the Liebers established an annual award for outstanding achievements in schizophrenia research. To date, two Lieber Prize winners have gone on to win Nobel Prizes. At Columbia University, they founded two centers of excellence - the Lieber Recovery and Rehabilitation Clinic for Psychotic Disorders and the Lieber Schizophrenic Clinic. At Williams College, they were the founders of the undergraduate neuroscience program. In 2011, they created the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, affiliated with the Johns Hopkins University, to integrate new discoveries in developmental neurobiology and genetics in order to achieve clinical advances that can change lives. Constance was a graduate of Brooklyn College and attended Columbia University for her post-graduate studies. She received honorary doctorates from Williams College and Brooklyn College. She received over two dozen awards to recognize her outstanding leadership, including: the Brooke Astor Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Advancement of Science, the Women in Science Award from The Rockefeller University, the Distinguished Service Award from the Yale University's Department of Psychiatry, and the Humanitarian Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry. Survivors include her beloved husband Stephen, her children Janice and Sam (Mary Rubin), her devoted grandson, her sister Beverly, and several nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her honor to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, 90 Park Avenue, 16th Floor, New York, New York 10016. A service will be held at Larchmont Temple, 75 Larchmont Avenue, on Tuesday, January 19th at 11:30am. Burial will be private. The family will receive visitors at the family home in Mamaroneck on Wednesday and Thursday from seven to nine o'clock in the evening. At a future time, a memorial service to celebrate Connie's extraordinary life will be held in Manhattan. Please contact the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation for details. 1/3\n",

Present, born April 3, 1934, passed away on January 12th from complication of Parkinson's Disease. He was 81 years old. His passing will be deeply mourned by Jane Werner Present, his wife, partner, lover and best friend of more than 59 years, his three children, their spouses, and four grandchildren, Tracy Present, Stephanie, Michael, Billy and Katherine Podalak, Douglas, Susan, Adam and Margot Present, and his sister Judy Present Liss; his friends, associates and the thousands of lives he touched during his 50 years of practice. Dan graduated from Syracuse University Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 and State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, Magna Cum Laude, in 1959. He completed an internship, medical residency, Gastroenterology residency and GI Fellowship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and entered private practice in 1964, where he quickly began to focus his attention on the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He was the recipient of the first research award given by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Dan brought clinical trials into clinical practice. His first paper was accepted for publication in 1966. He subsequently published 329 papers. At the time of his retirement, his publications had been cited more than 15,000 times. During his 54 years at Mt. Sinai, he served as President of both the Association of the Attending Staff and the Alumni Association for which he received the coveted Jacobi Medallion for Conspicuous Service to the Alumni. Dan received every award in his field including the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award, The American Gastroenterology Association Distinguished Clinician Award, Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, The WiIIiam Dock, M.D. Master Teacher Award in Medicine State University of New York, the Janssen Award for Outstanding Achievement Award in Clinical Gastroenterology, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Arents Award for Excellence in Medicine, the highest achievement awarded by Syracuse University. He is generally recognized as having pioneered the way Crohn's disease is treated. More than any recognition, Dan loved taking care of his patients. He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Contributions in Dan's memory may be made to the Present-Levison Fellowship at Mt.

      "HERZOG--Diana. Diana E. Herzog (nee Rigby) 76, of New York City and Southport, CT, passed away from complications after a stroke, on Wednesday, January 13, 2016 at her residence. Diana was born on June 23, 1939, in Stoke-on-Trent, England, to Elinor (Ada Allen) and Reginald Rigby. Diana attended the Courtauld Institute, in London, earning a bachelor's degree. She then studied Medieval art in Frieburg, Germany, and later at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University where she achieved a Master's in Fine Art. Diana moved to New York City in 1963, and married John E. Herzog, whom she had met on a trip to Mexico two years before. Diana and John lived in Manhattan, where Diana taught English as a second language at the New School, telling her devoted students that the pilgrims celebrated the first Thanksgiving in Philadelphia! Diana and John moved to Brooklyn Heights in 1972, where they were active in the Heights Casino and Plymouth Church. They summered in Clinton Corners, NY, where visitors could admire large vegetable beds and beehives, and later in Madison, CT, in the beautifully restored \"Red Top,\" with its view of the Long Island Sound. Diana started her career in collectible financial documents at R.M. Smythe & Co., first researching obsolete and inactive securities and then branching out into the field of autographs as the firm expanded into a leading auction house. Diana was a formidable business woman, securing important consignments and putting collectors together with the items they sought. Diana personally assembled autographs of British royalty, writers and poets, acquiring the nickname \"Lady Di.\" Diana was active in the Junior League of Brooklyn, Resources for Children with Special Needs, and many industry organizations including as president of the Manuscript Society, and PADA. Diana enjoyed membership in the Cosmopolitan Club and the Grolier Club. Diana edited the magazine \"Friends of Financial History\" for many years, now published by the Museum of American Finance, which she and John nurtured for over 25 years. As world travelers, Diana and John explored together, spending time in Europe and Asia, bringing home artifacts and anecdotes as well as cherished contacts. Diana accompanied John on many securities industry trips, supporting John at Herzog, Heine, Geduld. Diana's love of art and opera, her linguistic talents, and her culinary skills were well known by her friends and family. Her tennis game was graceful, and she loved reading, especially British mysteries. Diana cherished her roots in England, visiting often to maintain close relationships with family and friends \"across the pond.\" Diana will be missed by all who knew her, and especially by her family, who are deeply saddened by her passing. Diana is survived by her husband of over 50 years, John; her daughters, Mary (Andy Davidoff) and Sarah Shine (Kevin); her cousins, Michael J. Rigby, (Ann Sheridan) Pat Sharrock, and Anne Grabaskey (Peter); and her grandchildren, Keith and Sophie Shine. Diana's family is extremely grateful to Genevee Thomas, Veronica Vernon, and Joylynn Thomas for the wonderful care they took of Diana during her long illness. A memorial service will be held at Trinity Episcopal Church, 651 Pequot Avenue, Southport, CT 06890, on Wednesday, January 20, 2016, at 3:00pm. A reception at the church will follow. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to The Pequot Library, 720 Pequot Avenue, Southport, CT 06890, where Diana loved to go, and helped create two exhibits.

As she said: \"This is our dream, to find out what causes these disorders, and we felt it had to be a concerted effort, to study the brain and how it develops, and this is what the Institute is all about.\" The world of behavioral and developmental neuroscience has lost one of its strongest advocates and supporters.

      "LIEBER--Constance E. March 2, 1924 - January 15, 2016. Constance Lieber transformed her family's experience with significant mental illness into a life suffused with meaning, purpose, and extraordinary effectiveness. Few people could imagine the breadth and depth of her interests, ranging from the most creative modern art to inspiring architecture, exhilarating music, and insightful studies of neuroscience and human behavior. Guided by her compassion, dedication, and curiosity - as well as her personal relationships with scores of leading psychiatrists and neuroscientists - Constance informally advised thousands of parents who were desperately seeking better treatments and cures for their mentally ill children. During their sixty-five year marriage, Constance and her husband Stephen A. Lieber shared enduring love and intense intellectual insights to transform the field of basic and clinical research into the origins of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Since 1980, Constance and Steve have been among the leading public advocates and philanthropic supporters of schizophrenia and depression research in the US and around the globe. Their efforts included the creation of significant clinical and scientific institutions to support emerging discoveries in the fields of biological psychiatry and patient services. For over twenty-five years, they gave exemplary leadership to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD), the world's largest private funder of mental health research. Constance served as President from 1989 to 2007. In 2014, their activities were honored by the American Psychiatric Association with a Special Presidential Commendation, stating \"Constance and Steve have provided unwavering moral and material support to unravel the mysteries of the brain, and to better understand and treat mental illness.\" In 1987, the Liebers established an annual award for outstanding achievements in schizophrenia research. To date, two Lieber Prize winners have gone on to win Nobel Prizes. At Columbia University, they founded two centers of excellence - the Lieber Recovery and Rehabilitation Clinic for Psychotic Disorders and the Lieber Schizophrenic Clinic. At Williams College, they were the founders of the undergraduate neuroscience program. In 2011, they created the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, affiliated with the Johns Hopkins University, to integrate new discoveries in developmental neurobiology and genetics in order to achieve clinical advances that can change lives. Constance was a graduate of Brooklyn College and attended Columbia University for her post-graduate studies. She received honorary doctorates from Williams College and Brooklyn College. She received over two dozen awards to recognize her outstanding leadership, including: the Brooke Astor Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Advancement of Science, the Women in Science Award from The Rockefeller University, the Distinguished Service Award from the Yale University's Department of Psychiatry, and the Humanitarian Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry. Survivors include her beloved husband Stephen, her children Janice and Sam (Mary Rubin), her devoted grandson, her sister Beverly, and several nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her honor to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, 90 Park Avenue, 16th Floor, New York, New York 10016. A service will be held at Larchmont Temple, 75 Larchmont Avenue, on Tuesday, January 19th at 11:30am. Burial will be private. The family will receive visitors at the family home in Mamaroneck on Wednesday and Thursday from seven to nine o'clock in the evening. At a future time, a memorial service to celebrate Connie's extraordinary life will be held in Manhattan. Please contact the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation for details. 1/3\n",

In her role as President Emeritus, she continued to offer her vision and guidance to the Foundation on a regular basis. Connie, along with her husband Stephen, passionately believed in the need to seed the field of neuropsychiatric research with as many talented scientists as possible to make a substantive impact on the broad spectrum of mental health research, which she fervently understood holds our best hope for ending the immense suffering caused by mental illness. Since 1980, Connie and Steve have served as extraordinary philanthropic supporters and leading public advocates of schizophrenia and depression research. Connie worked tirelessly for the cause and grew our grants program to a total of $342 million and was helpful to so many families who were desperately seeking help for their children.

As the owner of a manufacturing business, he had clients throughout the City and watched neighborhoods change. He remembered horse drawn carriages filled the street and veterans of the Civil War parading in their uniforms on Memorial Day. His father survived the 1918 influenza and his uncle was gassed in World War I. Dad received an excellent public school education and graduated with highest honors from his high school while working for the Brooklyn Eagle covering sports. He entered Columbia in 1928 but to his great regret, had to leave to contribute to the support of his family. He made up for this perceived shortcoming by visiting libraries and museums. He became a connoisseur of drawings and paintings with a small collection. His deep commitment to the City was expressed in community service. Our father was the longest serving trustee of Congregation Emanu-El; he chaired many of its committees and he and our mother endowed its museum of Judaica. They were both actively involved in a number of charitable organizations. For Dad it included Montefiore Medical Center and UJA-Federation. He also was particularly proud of his service to his industry. For many years he was a board member of the Paperboard Packaging Council and served a term as its non-executive President. In addition to us he is survived by grandchildren, Geoffrey Dann, Deborah Fields, Adam Bernard and Claire Bernard, and great-grandchildren, Rebecca Dann, Emily Dann, and Lion Bernard De Rham.

As the owner of a manufacturing business, he had clients throughout the City and watched neighborhoods change. He remembered horse drawn carriages filled the street and veterans of the Civil War parading in their uniforms on Memorial Day. His father survived the 1918 influenza and his uncle was gassed in World War I. Dad received an excellent public school education and graduated with highest honors from his high school while working for the Brooklyn Eagle covering sports. He entered Columbia in 1928 but to his great regret, had to leave to contribute to the support of his family. He made up for this perceived shortcoming by visiting libraries and museums. He became a connoisseur of drawings and paintings with a small collection. His deep commitment to the City was expressed in community service. Our father was the longest serving trustee of Congregation Emanu-El; he chaired many of its committees and he and our mother endowed its museum of Judaica. They were both actively involved in a number of charitable organizations. For Dad it included Montefiore Medical Center and UJA-Federation. He also was particularly proud of his service to his industry. For many years he was a board member of the Paperboard Packaging Council and served a term as its non-executive President. In addition to us he is survived by grandchildren, Geoffrey Dann, Deborah Fields, Adam Bernard and Claire Bernard, and great-grandchildren, Rebecca Dann, Emily Dann, and Lion Bernard De Rham. There will be a private family funeral service. Contributions in his honor may be made to the Herbert and Eileen Bernard Museum Judaica Fund at Congregation Emanu-El.

      "GARIBALDI--Justice Marie L.,of Weehawken, NJ, passed on January 15, 2016. Justice Garibaldi was born November 26, 1934, in Jersey City to Dr. Louis and Marie S. Garibaldi. As an only child, she lived most of her life in Hudson County. The Garibaldis raised their daughter with a strong belief in equal opportunity for women and encouraged her to pursue a nontraditional career path. She was a pioneer and role model to so many. She is survived by loving cousins, adoring godchildren and many cherished friends and colleagues. As a child, Justice Garibaldi attended Stevens Hoboken Academy through 12th grade. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in economics and a political science minor from Connecticut College (New London, CT) in 1956. With an intent to follow in her grandfather's footsteps and attend business school, Justice Garibaldi learned first-hand women weren't accepted. Instead, she enrolled in Columbia Law School as a pathway into the business world and graduated in 1959. In 1963, Justice Garibaldi earned her Master of Laws degree in tax law from New York University School of Law. She was a member of the New Jersey, New York, and District of Columbia Bars and the first woman to serve as president of the New Jersey State Bar Association. Justice Garibaldi began her legal career with the New York Regional Counsel in the Internal Revenue Service. She received extensive trial experience in Tax Court. The Hatch Act restricted government employees from political speech-making and article-writing which ultimately caused Justice Garibaldi to make her next career move. She briefly worked at a firm now known as Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti (Riker, Danzig)-within three years she was made a partner which was virtually unheard of at that time. While at Riker, Danzig, Justice Garibaldi also served as a municipal court judge in Weehawken, NJ, from 1973 to 1975, writing the majority of opinion in several cases affecting women. Justice Garibaldi was introduced to Republican Thomas H. Kean by a Riker, Danzig partner. This ultimately led Justice Garibaldi to serve as co-chair of his gubernatorial campaign. Once elected, Governor Thomas H. Kean nominated Justice Garibaldi to the New Jersey Supreme Court. In 1982, Justice Garibaldi became the first woman appointed to the New Jersey Supreme Court- she served as Associate Justice of New Jersey's highest court until she retired in 2000. She authored more than 225 opinions while on the Supreme Court and was known for her advocacy of complementary dispute resolution. She chaired the Supreme Court's committee on that subject, and in 1998, the American Inns of Court Foundation established the Justice Marie L. Garibaldi American Inn of Court for Alternative Dispute Resolution. Justice Garibaldi was the recipient of many awards, including the Medal of Excellence from the Columbia University School of Law. She received honorary degrees from St. John's University Law School, Seton Hall University Law School, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Drew University, Upsala College, St. Peter's College, Caldwell College, and the College of Saint Elizabeth. Justice Garibaldi joined the Hackensack University Medical Center in 2001 and served as vice chair of Hackensack University Medical Center's Board of Governors. She also served on the Hackensack University Health Network's Board of Trustees, as chair of the Executive Compensation Committee and on the Hackensack University Medical Center Foundation's Board of Trustees. She chaired the Hudson Riverfront Performing Arts Center and served as a member of the Board of Directors of the National Italian American Foundation. Justice Garibaldi also served as a director of Crown Holdings, Inc. from 2000 to 2007. She also served as a member of the New Jersey Council on Local Mandates. In addition, Justice Garibaldi served as the secretary of the American Association Order of Malta, USA and executive vice president of the American Society of the Italian Legions of Merit. She also served as a director of the State Chamber of Commerce, New Jersey Bell Telephone Co., and the Washington Savings Bank. She also was a trustee of St. Peter's College. Justice Garibaldi truly enjoyed traveling, reading mysteries, and dinner and dancing with friends. She will be greatly missed by friends, loved ones and colleagues. Justice Marie L. Garibaldi was predeceased by her parents-her father, Dr. Louis Garibaldi passed away in 1975 and her mother, Marie S. Garibaldi passed away in 2013 at the age of 103. The funeral will be on Thursday, January 21 at 9am from the Leber Funeral Home in Union City then to St. Augustine Church where, at 10am, a Mass will be offered. Visitation will be on Tuesday, January 19 from 7 to 9pm, Wednesday, January 20 from 2 to 5pm and 7 to 9pm. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Hackensack University Medical Center Foundation, Hackensack, NJ; St. Augustine's School, Union City, NJ; Hudson Riverfront Performing Arts Center, Weehawken, NJ. 1/3\n",

The faculty and staff of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and the Maltz Research Laboratories at the Johns Hopkins Medical Campus mourn the loss of their inspirational and beloved Founder and Director, Constance Lieber. For more than 30 years, she led an international movement to bring research about behavioral brain disorders to the forefront of biomedical science. Connie Lieber's vision, her determination, and her historic generosity launched thousands of scientific careers. In 2010, she established the Lieber Institute for Brain Development because she was convinced that a new strategy was needed to accelerate progress and to find cures for developmental brain disorders. As she said: \"This is our dream, to find out what causes these disorders, and we felt it had to be a concerted effort, to study the brain and how it develops, and this is what the Institute is all about.\" The world of behavioral and developmental neuroscience has lost one of its strongest advocates and supporters. Connie is always in our hearts and minds. In honor of her passion and commitment, we will work tirelessly to achieve the mission she empowered us to pursue. 1/3\n",

The faculty and staff of Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons and its Department of Psychiatry, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute deeply mourn the passing of our beloved and dear friend, Connie Lieber. Connie and her husband, Steve, were generous supporters and inspirational leaders in the field of psychiatry. In the early 1980s, the Liebers joined the fledgling National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression, now the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. Their support and eventual leadership made BBRF the major source of private funding for research on mental illness. In addition to psychiatric research, the Liebers generously supported other programs at Columbia University over a 20-year period; their philanthropy benefited the training of M.D. and Ph.D. students, established the Lieber Center for Schizophrenia Research, and funded the Lieber Clinic for Recovery from Mental Illness. In 2014, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons honored the Liebers with the Crown Award. The entire Columbia community extends its deepest condolences to the Lieber Family.

      "ADES--Alan M. (1925-2016). Manhattan School of Music and its Board of Trustees are profoundly saddened by the passing of Alan M. Ades, a successful entrepreneur and deeply committed philanthropist who was a great friend to MSM and an influential force for progress at the School. A Trustee Emeritus who served as a member of the School's Board of Trustees for 21 years between 1990 and 2011, Mr. Ades, along with his wife Joan Taub Ades, made many profound contributions to MSM over the years, ensuring the School's advancement as one of the world's leading independent music conservatories. In addition to his important service as a member of MSM's Board, Mr. Ades' stewardship was reflected in his active commitment to the many MSM committees of which he was a member and by the generous leadership contributions he and Mrs. Ades made to the School, often by way of the Joan and Alan Ades-Taub Family Foundation. Many of Mr. Ades' most significant contributions to MSM were guided by his love of opera (he also served as a director at the Met Opera and Santa Fe Opera). In addition to providing generous support to MSM scholarships for classical vocalists, the Ades Family Foundation established and continues to fund the School's prestigious Alan M. and Joan Taub Ades Vocal Competition, an annual event that is judged by an esteemed panel of opera professionals and awards significant cash prizes to winning students. Perhaps most significant, Mr. and Mrs. Ades led the capital campaign for, and ultimately named, one of MSM's key performance and rehearsal spaces, an indispensable, flexible black-box space that not only accommodates full-scale opera and orchestral rehearsals, but also seats audiences of up to 200 for a wide variety of performances. This key addition to MSM's facility-the Alan M. and Joan Taub Ades Performance Space-opened its doors in 2007 and stands as a lively testament to the visionary leadership and generosity made to MSM by this prominent leader in business and philanthropy and his wife, Joan Taub Ades. Our Board of Trustees, Administration, Faculty, Alumni, and Current Students are united in expressing the MSM Community's sorrow at the passing of this singular individual. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Ades, whose continuing friendship we so highly cherish, and to the Ades family; we know that Alan's long, rich, accomplished life and the many wonderful memories it inspires will be a source of comfort and joy in the days and years ahead.

Lieber. Connie, who served as President of the Foundation from 1989 to 2007, felt that research was the best avenue to find meaningful and lasting solutions to alleviate the suffering caused by mental illness. In her role as President Emeritus, she continued to offer her vision and guidance to the Foundation on a regular basis. Connie, along with her husband Stephen, passionately believed in the need to seed the field of neuropsychiatric research with as many talented scientists as possible to make a substantive impact on the broad spectrum of mental health research, which she fervently understood holds our best hope for ending the immense suffering caused by mental illness. Since 1980, Connie and Steve have served as extraordinary philanthropic supporters and leading public advocates of schizophrenia and depression research. Connie worked tirelessly for the cause and grew our grants program to a total of $342 million and was helpful to so many families who were desperately seeking help for their children. We recognize that she enhanced the lives of so many through her work for Brain & Behavior Research Foundation and by supporting scientists throughout the world and have the deepest gratitude to both Connie and Steve. Their generosity in supporting research on mental illness is a great model for all of us.

      "POLLNER--Martin. The family of Martin Pollner mourns the passing of its devoted husband, father, grandfather and brother. In addition to his service to his family, Martin provided more than half a century of service to his country and to the legal profession, serving several United States presidents. He held senior positions with the United States government, including Deputy Attorney General under Robert F. Kennedy and Deputy Assistant of the Treasury and Director of Law Enforcement under Secretaries of the Treasury David Kennedy, John Connally and George Schultz. He helped develop civil rights legislation and developed and coordinated law enforcement policy within the Treasury Department, including the IRS, Customs, Secret Service and Interpol. In addition to service on various Cabinet committees, Martin headed the U.S. Delegation to several Interpol General Assemblies and, after returning to private practice, he was appointed by Secretary of State William P. Rogers as the U.S. representative to the International Narcotics Control Board of the United Nations, a position he held for several years. Over the years, Martin received numerous honors and awards, including the Townsend Harris Medal in 2005 and the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2007. After serving as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Martin, in private practice, advised and represented individuals, including CEO's of major corporations as well as numerous luminaries, and companies; investigated corporate misconduct; and untangled complex tax issues, workouts and bankruptcies. Notwithstanding a stellar legal career, nothing delighted him more than his family. He is survived by his wife Valerie, his sons Daniel and Richard, and their spouses, Melissa and Deb, granddaughters Gabriella, Rebakah and Lexi, and his brother Philip. He was entirely unique, and we will miss him. For those who wish to honor his memory, we ask that donations be made to The Rogosin Institute, www.rogosin.org/donate, The Hebrew Home at Riverdale, or Cardiovascular Institute Fund of Mt. Sinai. Service Thursday, January 21, 2016, 12 noon at \"The Riverside,\" 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave., NYC. 1/3\n",

      "DAYTON--Robert. Robert Dayton, whose career spanned decades in support of a vibrant downtown Minneapolis, MN, died on January 17th. He was 73 years old. A great-grandson of the founder of Daytons, Bob carried on the family retail and community-oriented legacy. After graduating from Yale in 1964, Bob joined what was to become Dayton Hudson and then Target, rising to become General Merchandise Manager and then Vice President of Stores. While with Daytons, Bob attended the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School. A merchandiser at heart, Bob became recognized for his deftness in identifying and supporting designers such as Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren early in their careers. In 1977 Bob left Daytons and purchased Harold, an upscale specialty store for women. Working together with his wife Joanie, Bob restored its iconic status as a Minneapolis retail institution. In 1984 Bob spearheaded the development of The Conservatory, the first enclosed shopping complex in Minneapolis. Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma. In 1992 Bob became CEO of Okabena, helping transform the Dayton family office into a nationally recognized leader in the then-nascent family office industry. Fiercely loyal to and enormously proud of the people and places he loved, Bob was committed to serving his community. He worked tirelessly on behalf of many non-profits including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, the United Way, and Westminster Presbyterian Church. In addition, Bob served as a Trustee of the Blake School, Carlton College, and the University of Minnesota Foundation. In 1994 Bob founded and was later named Chair Emeritus of the Mentoring Partnership of Minnesota. Bob grew up in Wayzata, Minnesota and attended Blake, Eaglebrook, and Taft. While at Yale, Bob met his wife Joanie, then attending Skidmore College, on a blind date at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. They were married in 1964 and had three boys. Bob enjoyed a number of hobbies, but none more so than golf. Beginning at Woodhill Country Club, his passion eventually extended east to Pine Valley and west to Cypress Point. He cofounded Spring Hill Golf Club and enjoyed playing in the U.S. Seniors. Bob will always be remembered for his warm heart, wonderful smile, infectious laughter, fantastic sense of humor, and tremendous spirit. He is survived by Joanie, his wife of 51 years, two brothers, three sons, and seven grandchildren.

      "ZIELENZIGER--Dr. Ruth, who helped change how Conservative Jews in America are taught the Bible, and inspired some of Israel's most enduring poetry of love while a young woman, died Thursday at the RiverWalk independent living facility of the Hebrew Home in the Bronx, one day shy of her 93rd birthday. Awarded her Doctorate of Hebrew Literature at age 66, Dr. Zielenziger was instrumental in creating the curriculum for teaching the books of Genesis and Exodus in Conservative Judaism at the Melton Research Center of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. The Melton program emphasized critical inquiry and the study of Bible for character education. She was a proponent of studying the creation myths and texts of other Middle Eastern cultures in order to better understand the context in which the Bible was written. Born in London, the daughter of Leo and Lola Herrmann, ardent Zionists, she grew up in Jerusalem before the founding of the Jewish state, and served as an ambulance driver and chauffeur in the British Army during World War II, where her fluency in Hebrew, English and German was invaluable. After the War, she attended the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where she met a German emigre and fellow student, Yehuda Pfeuffer, whom she renamed Yehuda Amichai. Amichai went on to become Israel's most celebrated poet, and the first drafts of many of his most enduring poems were composed as letters exchanged between the two. Amichai's letters to Dr. Zielenziger are now archived at Ben Gurion University in Israel. She moved to New York in 1947, to study at the Teachers Institute of the Seminary. While in New York she met and subsequently married Eric W. Zielenziger, a German Jewish survivor of the Holocaust who escaped the Nazis by living underground in Amsterdam for more than two years. They had two children. For 34 years, Dr. Zielenziger taught education at the Jewish Theological Seminary, after teaching for many years in Hebrew schools in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Before relocating to Riverdale in their later years the Zielenzigers lived primarily in Freeport and Great Neck, NY. She is survived by her sons David, of Great Neck, and Michael (Diane Abt) of Oakland, CA and Manhattan and a brother, Dr. Gabriel Herrmann of Jerusalem. Services will be held Friday at 11am at Riverside Nassau North, 55 N. Station Plaza, Great Neck, NY. 1/3\n",

      "DAYTON--Robert. Robert Dayton, whose career spanned decades in support of a vibrant downtown Minneapolis, MN, died on January 17th. He was 73 years old. A great-grandson of the founder of Daytons, Bob carried on the family retail and community-oriented legacy. After graduating from Yale in 1964, Bob joined what was to become Dayton Hudson and then Target, rising to become General Merchandise Manager and then Vice President of Stores. While with Daytons, Bob attended the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School. A merchandiser at heart, Bob became recognized for his deftness in identifying and supporting designers such as Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren early in their careers. In 1977 Bob left Daytons and purchased Harold, an upscale specialty store for women. Working together with his wife Joanie, Bob restored its iconic status as a Minneapolis retail institution. In 1984 Bob spearheaded the development of The Conservatory, the first enclosed shopping complex in Minneapolis. Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma. In 1992 Bob became CEO of Okabena, helping transform the Dayton family office into a nationally recognized leader in the then-nascent family office industry. Fiercely loyal to and enormously proud of the people and places he loved, Bob was committed to serving his community. He worked tirelessly on behalf of many non-profits including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, the United Way, and Westminster Presbyterian Church. In addition, Bob served as a Trustee of the Blake School, Carlton College, and the University of Minnesota Foundation. In 1994 Bob founded and was later named Chair Emeritus of the Mentoring Partnership of Minnesota. Bob grew up in Wayzata, Minnesota and attended Blake, Eaglebrook, and Taft. While at Yale, Bob met his wife Joanie, then attending Skidmore College, on a blind date at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. They were married in 1964 and had three boys. Bob enjoyed a number of hobbies, but none more so than golf. Beginning at Woodhill Country Club, his passion eventually extended east to Pine Valley and west to Cypress Point. He cofounded Spring Hill Golf Club and enjoyed playing in the U.S. Seniors. Bob will always be remembered for his warm heart, wonderful smile, infectious laughter, fantastic sense of humor, and tremendous spirit. He is survived by Joanie, his wife of 51 years, two brothers, three sons, and seven grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on February 18th at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis. 1/3\n",

      "VAN NESS--John R.,known as \"Jack,\" 70, of Ossining, NY, died peacefully with his wife at his side, January 19, 2016, at Rosary Hill Home after a short, courageous struggle with cancer. Jack was born in New York City, December 24, 1945, later preferring to tell folks he grew up on a small island off the coast of New Jersey. He studied at Stephens Institute of Technology and later earned his BS degree at Long Island University. Taking pre-med courses, he planned to follow in the footsteps of his deceased father, who was a NYC physician. All that changed when he took a summer job at Thomas J. Lipton company where he discovered the many faceted world of food science. His enthusiasm for food science never diminished. During his 20 year corporate career, he worked at a number of leading food companies including Best Food and Chesebrough Ponds. He gained experienced in every aspect of food processing, plant production, food safety, product development and federal filing regulations and practices. He was a trained taster who could recognize the individual spices in any combination presented, much to the surprise of restaurant chefs, a number of whom he advised and befriended over the years. As his career evolved, his focus centered on canned foods and he became one of New York's foremost food processing authorities. As such, he was a consultant who was recognized and worked with the United States Department of Agriculture and food processing. An avid sailor and scuba diver since his teens, Jack left the corporate world behind to sail from New York City to the Caribbean with a sailor buddy, exploring practically every island there during their six month cruise. Soon after his return, he formed his own company, Van Ness Food Technologies, which he operated while living aboard his 37 foot sailboat, \"Cruzin,\" docked at City Island, NY. In 1992, he found \"the love he had been waiting for\" when he met Carolyn, another enthusiastic scuba diver. They married in 2001 aboard a yacht in New York harbor. Throughout their years together, they traveled the world, lured by possible dive adventures in the Caribbean, Bora Bora, Europe, Mexico and the Red Sea. One of Jack's favorite sea stories was about his transatlantic sail aboard a 42 foot sailboat from Bermuda to Malaga, Spain. \"Sailing across the Pond is on every sailor's bucket list and I couldn't be happier or more satisfied because I got to do it,\" said Jack. Jack loved being with friends and sharing sea stories based on his experiences sailing with Carolyn up and down Long Island Sound, always on the lookout for a new raft up spot and seafood restaurant. For almost 30 years, Jack's consulting business worked with international clients in Canada, Greece, Israel and Korea. He was a featured lecturer at the First Food Safety Conference held in Bangalore, India, where he taught Indian food scientists how to implement Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point safety principles. Jack was a hands on expert who knew how to build and manage a food plant from its conception to the time the canned food product was on the pallet ready to go to market. He was known for his strong sense of integrity and absolute dedication to ensuring the safety of any food product under his production management. He was a charter member of IFTPS, participating in annual food conferences in the US and abroad. Jack was more than generous in passing along his wealth of knowledge to his many clients, interspersed with updates about his latest sailing or diving adventures. His genuine enjoyment of life was contagious. It enabled Jack to engage in lively conversations and make friends with young and old alike. With the wind at his back, he has charted his course, leaving us with memories of an unforgettable personality, sharp wit, brilliant mind and smile. Besides his beloved wife, Carolyn, he leaves behind a worldwide group of business associates and longtime friends, whose many lives he touched. At his request, his ashes are to be scattered over the area waters that gave him so much pleasure. There will be a celebration of Jack's life during the coming sailing season. 1/3\n",

      "WASHINGTON--Bryan R.,professor of late 19th and 20th century American literature and cultural studies, and a man of considerable wit, humor, style, elegance, and charm, with a passion for the beauty and joy of some of life's most abundant and finest offerings, died of cancer on December 31, 2015. He was 57. The son of Dr. Joseph R. Washington, Jr. and the late Sophia M. Washington, Bryan was born in Boston, Massachusetts. During his formative years, Bryan lived in numerous towns and cities in Wisconsin, Virginia, California, and Pennsylvania, where he attended the University of Pennsylvania. At UPenn, Bryan was a Benjamin Franklin Scholar; he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree (with honors) in General Literature in 1980. UPenn served as a catalyst for Bryan's graduate studies, which led him to complete his Master's Degree in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford University in 1982 through Penn's Thouron Award, a British-American exchange program. Bryan received his second Master's Degree in English and American Language at Harvard University in 1985. He was also a Minority Prize Fellow from 1982-1987. Bryan received his Ph.D. in English and American Literature and Language from Harvard in 1989. Bryan launched his academic career as an instructor at Lafayette College in 1987 and was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1989. He served as a Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University from 1991-1992. In 1994, Bryan was promoted to Associate Professor with full tenure. Bryan's scholarly work includes the publication of a book entitled \"The Politics of Exile: The Ideology in Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and James Baldwin\" in 1995. The book was well received and widely cited. It is considered by many to be one of the first works to position James Baldwin alongside white canonical American authors. Bryan also authored several articles and reviews, including: \"Paris Blues(s),\" an essay on James Baldwin; and \"WASP Mischief: Martha Stewart and the Racial Status Quo.\" He was in the process of writing two books before he became ill. Throughout his career at Lafayette, which spanned over a quarter century, Bryan received numerous honors, including the Student Government Superior Teaching Award in 1989-1990 and 1992-1993, which is rare for a professor to receive twice. Bryan delivered presentations at Lafayette on topics such as \"Blacks in Popular Culture\" and \"Black Writers in the Classroom.\" In May 2014, Bryan delivered \"The Last Lecture\" to graduating seniors; this was, sadly, Bryan's last lecture and last professional engagement. The title of the lecture was: \"In the Course of It All: Life is Words;\" this honor, along with the two student government teaching awards, suggests how deeply he was loved by his students- his courses were always over-enrolled. Students described him as inspiring, exciting, funny, and extremely smart. Bryan once described his teaching in the following terms: \"If asked what I aim to accomplish in the classroom, I would say I am trying for a good conversation. For in all my courses dialogue is a primary emphasis. I enjoy lecturing, but my class presentations, generally, are designed to provoke dissuasion. Whether just beginning college work or about to finish, undergraduates (I believe) have something to teach me.\" As a resident of Doylestown, PA, Bryan's life included jazz and the American songbook as a joy, metaphor and interpretation of his many passions: writing, literary criticism, food, art, \"beautiful things,\" and, of course, Paris. During evenings, he would often play his stereo or the piano and sing to Carmen McRae, Shirley Horn or other great jazz artists, while duck was in the oven (or some other scrumptious dish) along with a plate of pate and wine at the ready, all for the evening's feast to be shared with Russell Clinton, his husband and life partner for 23 years, and, on many occasions, close friends. During his stay fighting cancer in various hospitals and healthcare facilities, Bryan often said that the rooms that he was in were \"simply awful\", and \"he wants to go out in style\" - of course his care and room assignments were, in fact, top notch! But, we all know Bryan and his desire to be surrounded by beauty. So, what did he do to dress up his room(s)? He buys a beautifully designed Simon Pearce lamp for only a brief stay. And, at Christmas, even though he was unable to eat solid foods or drink, he had a bounty of epicurean delights delivered from Dean and Deluca for him to taste and smell, including his favorite wines and brandy, all for the decadence of it all, and to celebrate his favorite holiday in abundance with his dear Russell. In addition to his husband Russell, Bryan is survived by his father, Joseph; father and mother-in-law, Bill and Ruthann; brother, David, and his partner, Christine; Russell's sister, Debbie and her children Calvin, Travis and Kiara and numerous other family members and friends. A celebration of Bryan's life will be held at 4pm, Friday, January 29, 2016 at Buckingham Friends School, 5684 York Road, Lahaska, PA. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania Annual Fund, Penn Medicine Development, 3535 Market Street, Suite 750, Philadelphia, PA 19104 or online at https://www.cancer. pennmedicine.org.

A great-grandson of the founder of Daytons, Bob carried on the family retail and community-oriented legacy. After graduating from Yale in 1964, Bob joined what was to become Dayton Hudson and then Target, rising to become General Merchandise Manager and then Vice President of Stores. While with Daytons, Bob attended the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School. A merchandiser at heart, Bob became recognized for his deftness in identifying and supporting designers such as Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren early in their careers. In 1977 Bob left Daytons and purchased Harold, an upscale specialty store for women. Working together with his wife Joanie, Bob restored its iconic status as a Minneapolis retail institution. In 1984 Bob spearheaded the development of The Conservatory, the first enclosed shopping complex in Minneapolis. Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma. In 1992 Bob became CEO of Okabena, helping transform the Dayton family office into a nationally recognized leader in the then-nascent family office industry. Fiercely loyal to and enormously proud of the people and places he loved, Bob was committed to serving his community. He worked tirelessly on behalf of many non-profits including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, the United Way, and Westminster Presbyterian Church. In addition, Bob served as a Trustee of the Blake School, Carlton College, and the University of Minnesota Foundation. In 1994 Bob founded and was later named Chair Emeritus of the Mentoring Partnership of Minnesota. Bob grew up in Wayzata, Minnesota and attended Blake, Eaglebrook, and Taft. While at Yale, Bob met his wife Joanie, then attending Skidmore College, on a blind date at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. They were married in 1964 and had three boys. Bob enjoyed a number of hobbies, but none more so than golf. Beginning at Woodhill Country Club, his passion eventually extended east to Pine Valley and west to Cypress Point. He cofounded Spring Hill Golf Club and enjoyed playing in the U.S. Seniors. Bob will always be remembered for his warm heart, wonderful smile, infectious laughter, fantastic sense of humor, and tremendous spirit.

George Weidenfeld grew up in Vienna and fled Austria after the Nazi takeover in 1938. Because he was saved by a Christian family, George never forgot that his life was spared by Christians and just last year, he created a foundation to rescue thousands of persecuted Christians in the Middle East. This man never forgot his debts and always repaid them. As an immigrant during World War II, George became an integral part of the BBC World Service and broadcast reports in several languages. In 1969, Queen Elizabeth acknowledged Britain's appreciation and knighted him, followed by a life peerage in the House of Lords in 1976. Last April, at the age of 95, Lord Weidenfeld was awarded the WJC's Theodor Herzl Award in London and became an honorary vice-president of the World Jewish Congress.

Awarded her Doctorate of Hebrew Literature at age 66, Dr. Zielenziger was instrumental in creating the curriculum for teaching the books of Genesis and Exodus in Conservative Judaism at the Melton Research Center of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. The Melton program emphasized critical inquiry and the study of Bible for character education. She was a proponent of studying the creation myths and texts of other Middle Eastern cultures in order to better understand the context in which the Bible was written. Born in London, the daughter of Leo and Lola Herrmann, ardent Zionists, she grew up in Jerusalem before the founding of the Jewish state, and served as an ambulance driver and chauffeur in the British Army during World War II, where her fluency in Hebrew, English and German was invaluable. After the War, she attended the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where she met a German emigre and fellow student, Yehuda Pfeuffer, whom she renamed Yehuda Amichai. Amichai went on to become Israel's most celebrated poet, and the first drafts of many of his most enduring poems were composed as letters exchanged between the two. Amichai's letters to Dr. Zielenziger are now archived at Ben Gurion University in Israel. She moved to New York in 1947, to study at the Teachers Institute of the Seminary. While in New York she met and subsequently married Eric W. Zielenziger, a German Jewish survivor of the Holocaust who escaped the Nazis by living underground in Amsterdam for more than two years. They had two children. For 34 years, Dr. Zielenziger taught education at the Jewish Theological Seminary, after teaching for many years in Hebrew schools in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Before relocating to Riverdale in their later years the Zielenzigers lived primarily in Freeport and Great Neck, NY. She is survived by her sons David, of Great Neck, and Michael (Diane Abt) of Oakland, CA and Manhattan and a brother, Dr. Gabriel Herrmann of Jerusalem. 1/3\n",

After earning a Master of Architecture degree from Yale University, Fredenburgh worked for a quarter century at I.M. Pei & Partners, where he was an associate partner and design principal. He established his own office, Fredenburgh Wegierska-Mutin Architects, in 1990. In his work with the Pei firm and in independent practice, each of his buildings marked its setting with iconic forms and distinctive public spaces, from a master planned waterfront promenade in Dubai to the iconic CenTrust Tower in Miami, Texas Commerce Tower in Houston, and First Interstate World Center, the tallest building west of Chicago, which provides a memorable centerpoint to the vast horizontal landscape of Los Angeles. Harold Fredenburgh also made major contributions to the design of the John Hancock Tower in Boston. Fredenburgh's efforts in landmark preservation and planning policy contributed to shaping New York City. For two decades his leadership in planning and design review in his home community of Bronxville, New York, was instrumental in preserving the unique character of a landmark residential village while allowing it to meet the challenges of contemporary needs. He was a guiding voice on the Scholarship and Brunner Award Committees of the American Institute of Architects/New York Chapter, a member of the Planning and Urban Design Committee, and a founding member of the Society of Architectural Historians. An unusually well read and scholarly architect, he was an accomplished international lecturer on design and urban planning issues, and was widely regarded in both the university and in the office as a dedicated teacher and ardent advocate of young professionals. As a consequence of his experience with the design of tall buildings, in 1998 he was elected one of four American members of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Building Sciences. He was elevated to Fellowship in the American Institute of Architects in 2014. Harold Fredenburgh will be very missed by his daughter Audrey Mateer, son-in-law Robert Williams, Anna Mutin, friends and colleagues. 1/3\n",

      "WEIDENFELD--Lord George The America-Israel Friendship League expresses its great sorrow at the passing of Lord George Weidenfeld. His wisdom, experience, good will and warm friendship can never be replaced and will never be forgotten. His activities in support of efforts to resolve the challenges of international affairs involved intimate contact with world leaders at the highest levels. He will especially be remembered for guiding the renewal of German participation in world affairs which accelerated Germany's acceptance in the councils of peace and constructive dialogue. His commitment to the survival and success of Israel in world affairs can be matched by few participants in international diplomacy. We send our sincere condolences to Lady Weidenfeld and his adoring family. Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Honorary President; Kenneth J.

      "KENNEDY--Michael John, on January 25, 2016 at age 78 of cancer. Civil rights lawyer who fought for the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Mr. Kennedy, whose career as both a civil liberties and criminal attorney began in California in the 1960s, successfully defended Black Panther Huey Newton on manslaughter and murder charges in Oakland. In San Francisco, he won acquittal for all seven young Mexican Americans, Los Siete de la Raza, charged with murdering a police officer in the city's Mission District. And when Jimmy Mitchell, co-owner of San Francisco's notorious O'Farrell Theatre-which journalist Hunter S. Thompson called 'The Carnegie Hall of Public Sex'-was accused of killing his brother Artie in a drunken rage, Mr. Kennedy succeeded in having the charge reduced from murder in the second degree to manslaughter. In Illinois he represented Rennie Davis, a member of the Chicago Eight accused of conspiracy and inciting a riot during the 1968 Democratic National Convention and served as Mr. Davis's lawyer before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C. He also represented Bernardine Dohrn who belonged to 1960s radical group, The Weathermen. Other of his clients belonged to the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the most famous member of which was Timothy Leary, LSD guru to a generation. In Lincoln, Nebraska, Mr. Kennedy won acquittal for a Penobscot Native American charged with assaulting FBI agents at Wounded Knee. Perhaps his most famous trial and certainly the most time consuming-it still remains the longest criminal jury trial in U.S. Federal Court history-was The Pizza Connection; the name came from accusations of drug money laundering through pizza parlors in New York City. When the U.S. Attorney put two warring mafia families on trial, the case played out like a drama between the Capulets and the Montagues with Mr. Kennedy retained as chief council representing one of the godfathers, Sicilian mob boss Gaetano Badalamenti. Wire taps were the basis for charges against six Americans raising money in New York to buy weapons for the IRA in Ireland. As lead council, Mr. Kennedy won an acquittal for all six men. He also won clemency from New York Governor Mario Cuomo for Jean Harris, the private girls' school headmistress who was in prison for the notorious murder of her lover, Scarsdale Diet doctor Herman Tarnower. Mr. Kennedy worked on only one divorce case in his career and although the settlement was sealed, reliable sources reported that Ivana Trump was very pleased. There were many pro-bono cases about which no one has written. And there were many times when people from all walks of life, the high, the low, and the undocumented, sought Kennedy's advice privately and many times he privately reached out to connections, sometimes in the government, sometimes in the underworld. As general council to High Times Magazine for 41 years, Mr. Kennedy and his friend, the magazine's founder, the late Tom Forcade, sought to subvert prohibition of marijuana. When a reporter recently asked Mr. Kennedy how he kept High Times out of trouble for so long, he replied simply that he had never asked or allowed them to do anything illegal but added: \"At High Times we will never forget what was done in the name of law enforcement to our scarred arrestees, and those who still rot in prison for daring to try to enjoy themselves peacefully and harmlessly.\" Mr. Kennedy was the consummate gentleman, with a quick Irish wit and a quick Irish temper. But he very rarely raised his voice, being the personification of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy: Speak softly but carry a big stick. The romance between Michael Kennedy and Eleanora, his wife of forty-seven years, is the stuff of fairy tales. Marrying after love at first sight, they never spent a night apart and sometimes signed their names as one word. Although not an attorney, Mrs. Kennedy was her husband's most trusted associate and confidant working entirely behind the scenes on every case, becoming an unofficial voir dire expert. The couple eschewed the label 'socialite' but could be seen often at benefits for Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, the Central Park Conservancy and the United Nations. They gave as many parties as they attended, a number of which were chronicled in New York Magazine and the New York Social Diary. When not working or traveling, Mr. Kennedy spent his time between New York City, his Hamptons home Kilkare, his old Key West cottage in West Palm Beach and his house in Ireland's Black Valley. Michael John Kennedy, who died at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, was born in the state of Washington in 1937. After boarding school in Washington, he attended University of California at Berkeley and Hastings Law School. Besides his wife Eleanora, he leaves his daughters Anna Safir and Lisa Kennedy, his son Scott Hamilton Kennedy, three granddaughters and two grandsons. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Wednesday from 2-4 and 6-8pm. The funeral service will be held on Thursday at 10am at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle, 60th Street and Columbus Avenue. 1/3\n",

      "KENNEDY--Michael John. On January 25, 2016 at age 78 of cancer. Civil rights lawyer who fought for the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Mr. Kennedy, whose career as both a civil liberties and criminal attorney began in California in the 1960s and culminated in 2009 as Special Advisor to the President of the United Nations, Miguel D'Escoto. He successfully defended Black Panther Huey Newton on manslaughter and murder charges in Oakland. In San Francisco, he won acquittal for all seven young Mexican Americans, Los Siete de la Raza, charged with murdering a police officer in the city's Mission District. And when Jimmy Mitchell, co- owner of San Francisco's notorious O'Farrell Theatre- which journalist Hunter S. Thompson called 'The Carnegie Hall of Public Sex'-was accused of killing his brother Artie in a drunken rage, Mr. Kennedy succeeded in having the charge reduced from murder in the second degree to manslaughter. In Illinois he represented Rennie Davis, a member of the Chicago Eight accused of conspiracy and inciting a riot during the 1968 Democratic National Convention and served as Mr. Davis's lawyer before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C. He also represented Bernardine Dohrn who belonged to 1960s radical group, The Weathermen. Other of his clients belonged to the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the most famous member of which was Timothy Leary, LSD guru to a generation. In Lincoln, Nebraska, Mr. Kennedy won acquittal for a Penobscot Native American charged with assaulting FBI agents at Wounded Knee. Perhaps his most famous trial and certainly the most time consuming-it still remains the longest criminal jury trial in U.S. Federal Court history-was The Pizza Connection; the name came from accusations of drug money laundering through pizza parlors in New York City. When the U.S. Attorney put two warring mafia families on trial, the case played out like a drama between the Capulets and the Montagues with Mr. Kennedy retained as chief council representing one of the godfathers, Sicilian mob boss Gaetano Badalamenti. Wire taps were the basis for charges against six Americans raising money in New York to buy weapons for the IRA in Ireland. As lead council, Mr. Kennedy won an acquittal for all six men. He also won clemency from New York Governor Mario Cuomo for Jean Harris, the private girls' school headmistress who was in prison for the notorious murder of her lover, Scarsdale Diet doctor Herman Tarnower. Mr. Kennedy worked on only one divorce case in his career and although the settlement was sealed, reliable sources reported that Ivana Trump was very pleased. There were many pro-bono cases about which no one has written. And there were many times when people from all walks of life, the high, the low, and the undocumented, sought Kennedy's advice privately and many times he privately reached out to connections, sometimes in the government, sometimes in the underworld. As general council to High Times Magazine for 41 years, Mr. Kennedy and his friend, the magazine's founder, the late Tom Forcade, sought to subvert prohibition of marijuana. When a reporter recently asked Mr. Kennedy how he kept High Times out of trouble for so long, he replied simply that he had never asked or allowed them to do anything illegal but added: \"At High Times we will never forget what was done in the name of law enforcement to our scarred arrestees, and those who still rot in prison for daring to try to enjoy themselves peacefully and harmlessly.\" Mr. Kennedy was the consummate gentleman, with a quick Irish wit and a quick Irish temper. But he very rarely raised his voice, being the personification of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy: Speak softly but carry a big stick. The romance between Michael Kennedy and Eleanora, his wife of forty-seven years, is the stuff of fairy tales. Marrying after love at first sight, they never spent a night apart and sometimes signed their names as one word. Although not an attorney, Mrs. Kennedy was her husband's most trusted associate and confidant working entirely behind the scenes on every case, becoming an unofficial voir dire expert. The couple eschewed the label 'socialite' but could be seen often at benefits for Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, the Central Park Conservancy and the United Nations. They gave as many parties as they attended, a number of which were chronicled in New York Magazine and the New York Social Diary. When not working or traveling, Mr. Kennedy spent his time between New York City, his Hamptons home Kilkare, his old Key West cottage in West Palm Beach and his house in Ireland's Black Valley. Michael John Kennedy, who died at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, was born in the state of Washington in 1937. After boarding school in Washington, he attended University of California at Berkeley and Hastings Law School. Besides his wife Eleanora, he leaves his daughters Anna Safir and Lisa Kennedy, his son Scott Hamilton Kennedy, three granddaughters and two grandsons. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Wednesday from 2-4 and 6-8pm.

      "DRAZEN--Ruth Yorkin. We mourn the loss of Ruth Yorkin Drazen-mother, filmmaker and pioneer in genetics-who died quietly in her sleep on Monday evening at the age of 97. Ruth was born in Washington, PA on May 15, 1918, the daughter of Jesse Sachs Yorkin and Maurice A. Yorkin. Ruth adored classical music from early childhood on, studying piano at the Curtis School of Music with Henry Kaufman. In 1938 she married fellow Curtis student, Mario Berini, and they moved to New York City, where Mario began his career as a tenor with the Met. Their only child, Anton, died in infancy of a rare genetic disease, and Ruth's grief sparked her interest in curing genetic illnesses. She spent years working tirelessly as executive director of The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The National Genetics Foundation. When her second husband, New York attorney Jerome Drazen, died of prostate cancer in 1988, she developed an abiding passion for the subject of humanism in medicine, expressing it through the making of documentary films, which she continued to create into her early nineties. Her first film, \"When Doctors Get Cancer,\" was a sensitive look at doctors treating other doctors, in the hope that it might make more humane the care that physicians gave, when they were able to observe themselves as cancer patients. Five other award-winning films followed, most of them shown on PBS. They included, \"The Choice is Yours,\" the inspirational life of the great psychiatrist, Victor Frankl, \"A Wayfayer's Journey; Listening to Mahler;\" \"Notes From the Edge, the Diary of Peter J. Morgan, M.D.,\" an intimate narrative of the last two years of the life of a 29-year old physician diagnosed with cancer, and \"Healing Through Humanism,\" a five DVD teaching series devoted to the practice of compassionate medicine. Ruth was an intellectual and spiritual inspiration to everyone she touched, and will be sorely missed. Ruth is survived by a son, Myron Drazen and daughter-in-law, Lucille; a sister, Martha Yorkin Berman; two step-sons, Michael and Roger Drazen and seven grandchildren, Julie, Debra, Jacob, Dylan, Emily, Kate and Zoe Drazen. She was predeceased by a son, Anton Berini, as well as brother Alan \"Bud\" Yorkin; husbands Mario Berini and Jerome Drazen.

George was born on April 23, 1917 in Brooklyn, New York, and attended both City College and Pratt Institute. George was an accomplished businessman, Chairman and CEO of National Die and Button Mould Company. He loved sports, including fishing, golfing, skiing and horse racing. And was a great comrade among his peers. He practiced hatha yoga, deep breathing and exercised throughout his life. He also enjoyed collecting art and adding to his collection-and loaned selected pieces to museums. He had a sense of humor and outstanding charm with elegance and wit. Everyone loved him-children, adults, friends and peers. His writings and his conversations were always enlightening to hear. He was a World War II veteran and fought in battles and campaigns, including Ardennes, Central Europe, Rhineland, Normandy, Northern France, and Belgium. Throughout his life he belonged to many clubs, including the Seawane Country Club and the Lone Star Boat Club. He was a religious man and a member of Central Synagogue. For over 70 years he designed and manufactured varieties of metal stampings-nailheads, studs, rhinestones and settings, metal and covered buttons, buckles, and other metal works. His customers included leaders in the fashion industry, automotive, aviation, and the United States Military. He loved people and could converse with anyone on any level-he would always light up a room. His time in World War II as a French interpreter and radar specialist in the anti-aircraft division, and his participation in the Battle of the Bulge and the invasion of Normandy left him with many great stories that he loved to share. These stories always interested everyone who met him. He is survived by his wife-Therese; sister-Hilda; four children-Jackson/Marina, Marvin/Victoria, Robert, Eileen; two stepchildren-Pamela/Jay, James/Ana; eight grandchildren-Lana/David, Ivy, Abigail, Cooper, Maria, Marella, Brian, Tod; and his loyal dog-Guy.

Born in Montreal, he attended McGill University, edited The McGill Daily, and earned his M.D. at the University of Saskatchewan, where he met Mary, his wife of 54 years. As head of Psychiatry for the New York City Welfare Department under Mayor Koch, he waged a prescient fight against the impending homeless crisis. His patients ranged from celebrities to the indigent, and he was deeply committed to each one as an individual. A broad smile and a winning sense of humor told you instantly that you were in the presence of someone who would sympathetically take the full measure of your being. His stamina was superhuman; he worked long hours and still made himself available round the clock until the day he entered the hospital. His involvement was uncommonly broad, running from child to geriatric, from drugs and talk therapy, to being a pioneer in public psychiatry. Lover of hootenannies, Leadbelly, and opera; gourmet and wine connoisseur; tennis player and fan; magnanimous host and storyteller, Dr. Reich is survived by Mary, two children, Jim and Sharon, and three grandchildren. A funeral service will be held at Riverside North Chapel in Great Neck, on Friday, January 29, at 11:30 am. 1/3\n",

Hudner died at home in Little Compton, RI on January 14, 2016 following a thirteen month battle with glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer. Hope is survived by her husband of 40 years, Michael, and her daughter, Bay, who were deeply involved as caregivers and comforters during the past year, and were at her side at the time of her peaceful passing. Hope is also survived by her aunt, Judy Freeman N. Gross; brothers, Ambassador Charles \"Chas\" W. Freeman, Jr. (Margaret Carpenter) and Robert P. Freeman (Inge Reist); their five children and nine grandchildren (Hope's grand-nieces and -nephews); siblings-in-law, Mr. Kennedy Hudner (Jennifer), Ms. Cornelia Futterman (Michael), and Ms. Kristina Beitman (Harty), and their five children. Hope was born on January 11, 1951 in Nassau, The Bahamas, and lived there until age 10, then alternating time in Southern California with years in Providence and Bristol, RI. Hope was predeceased by her son, Michael Ripley (\"Rip\") Hudner, and her parents (father, Charles Wellman Freeman, and mother, Carla Park Freeman, who died when Hope was 20 months old). Hope was largely raised by her two sets of deceased grandparents, Hovey T. and Marjorie W. Freeman of Providence and Bristol, and George C. and Fentress K. Park of Wollaston, MA and Roaring Brook, MI. Hope graduated from The Lincoln School, Providence (1969), Smith College (1973), and also acquired an MFA from New York University. The family lived in New York City from 1974 through 1994, and then resided in Little Compton and Providence, RI. Hope was an accomplished artist and designer with a portfolio including work in graphic, interior, jewelry, and apparel design. These efforts led to her 2013 creation of Hope Hudner Designs, focused on elegant silk infinity scarves. Hope was deeply involved in Rhode Island public service, including, at various times, board and/or development responsibilities at Moses Brown School, Women & Infants Hospital, Rhode Islanders Sponsoring Education (RISE), RISD Museum, Perennial Planters, The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America (Rhode Island), and Providence Preservation Society. Hope's social involvements included membership in the Providence Art Club, Colony Club of New York City, Lyford Cay Club, Sakonnet Golf Club, and Sakonnet Point Club. Hope had great admiration for the natural world and actively cultivated a sense of wonder: she was a faithful student of plants and flowers (as evidenced by the thousands of bulbs planted across Rhode Island, Maine, and New York); she loved sailing with her family and friends (countless excursions on Narragansett Bay and longer trips to Maine, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Ireland number among the most special); and her keen curiosity led her to explore the far corners of the world, from Spain and Taiwan at age 18 to Antarctica at 49, covering every other continent and many countries in between. Hope had enormous energy, deep intelligence, natural grace, and remarkable warmth. She believed that life presented endless opportunity to learn, remarking on the tenth anniversary of her son's death that, \"Each time it rains in our lives, we are given an opportunity for further growth. I am grateful for the challenges in my life as chances to grow and blossom.\" Hope faced her illness with the same fortitude and poise. While she was indeed a lifelong learner, Hope was perhaps most notable as a teacher of these invaluable lessons to the rest of us. Hope felt a profound duty to embrace everyone she encountered with love and kindness, and she shared this love of people and life like water from a fire hose. All within range were enriched by her presence and generosity of spirit. Hope inspired people to think lovingly and boldly on behalf of the larger community, themselves, and their friends, prompting many to find more inside themselves to enhance their own lives and those of others. A college classmate of Bay's said it beautifully in a recent note to Hope: \"You feature prominently as an inspiration for the life I want to live-to pursue my interests, to live fully and with panache, to spend time in nature, and, most of all, to be kind to people. I know I am just one of the many, many people you affect in this way!\" A celebration of Hope's life will be held in Little Compton in early June on a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions in Hope's memory be made to: the Rip Hudner Memorial Fund at Moses Brown School, Providence; Dr. Patrick Wen's Research in Neuro-Oncology at Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston; or a charity of your choice. Above all, the family encourages you to remember Hope by engaging with the world through love and kindness. 1/3\n",

      "SLOAN--Howard, WWII bomber pilot, former Chairman of New York Blood Center, died at 91. From a base in East Anglia during World War II, 19 year old Howard Sloan flew 33 missions over Germany. His B-24 was named \"The Stork Club.\" When praised for his bravery, he would invariably respond: \"Was there a choice?\" Cheers erupted from a crowd on the beach when, piloting his plane home to the states after the war, he dipped his wings over the Inwood Country Club. Mr. Sloan was born in New York City on March 20, 1924. He graduated from the Woodmere Academy and Pawling Preparatory School, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, Class of '45W. He and his late wife, Sonny, along with George and Barbara Bush, were the only two married couples on campus. Dreams of business school were dashed by financial necessity and he joined his father's insurance company, Harris, Sloan and Finn. Characteristically, he turned the experience into a colorful one, representing clients such as Restaurant Associates; Richard Burton, who dispatched him to Rome to deliver a diamond he'd bought at auction for Elizabeth Taylor, or Cartier to present a love bracelet to Valentino, who insisted Howard personally fasten it on his wrist. He became an art insurer, developing great interest and knowledge of art in the process, befriending numerous artists and inspiring a lifetime of collecting: Mayan and PreColumbian sculpture, works by artists as diverse as Giacometti and Bill King, Henry Moore and Lindner. He acquired an art gallery, Multiples, for his wife, Sonny, and Marian Goodman to run. In 1990, he was invited by his friend and mentor, Charles Wohlstetter, to become a partner in the latter's acquisitions of hundreds of independent telephone companies from Alaska to California. They formed Continental Telephone, later known as Contel, in 1962. The company then agreed to be acquired by GTE, a combination that created the nation's largest local telephone company. Sloan remained on the Board of GTE until it was restructured as Verizon. In 1968, an American syndicate acquired an 18th century chateau in Bordeaux with Wohlstetter and Sloan installed as new owners. Chateau Bouscaut was the second most beautiful vineyard in Bordeaux, Sloan proclaimed, second, he said, because he didn't want to boast. Among the many American guests who flocked to visit, his favorite was Mary Lindsay, whom he overheard saying to her husband, then mayor of NYC, \"John, if I have to see one more vineyard, I'll kill myself.\" To Sloan's eternal regret, Bouscat was sold in 1980. Mayor Lindsay brought Sloan onto the board of the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1984. At that time, according to Andre Bishop, current artistic director, \"Nobody would give you a nickel for the Beaumont.\" It is now one of the leading theatrical companies in New York, if not the world. Mr. Sloan served on the Board until his death on Thursday. In 1977, Sloan joined the Board of Trustees of the New York Blood Center, of which he was Chairman from 1993 to 2000, nominating his successor, Howard Milstein. In January 2013, a congressional extension prepared by Representative Carolyn Maloney in recognition of Mr. Sloan's 15 years of distinguished service and dedication to NYBC's mission, was entered into the congressional record. She cited his humanitarian status and commended his leadership and tireless advocacy. For several years, he presided as Chairman of Northside Center for Child Development, founded by Kenneth and Mamie Clarke, earning a colleague's recent comment, \"There was a time this place wouldn't have existed without Howard Sloan.\" He and his wife are to be honored for their dedication to Northside at a gala in May 2017. Howard Sloan died of kidney failure in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital on January 21, 2016. Handsome as a film star, he will be remembered for his elegance and extraordinary wit. He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Kathryn Roth of Weston, Massachusetts, Gillis Cone of Woodbury, Connecticut; a son, Douglas Sloan, of Palm Beach; a stepdaughter, Paulette Bartlett Robinson, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren. Interment will be private and a memorial service will take place at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home on Wednesday, February 10th. 1/3\n",

After 96 years of laughing, loving, shouting, learning, teaching, and building, Henry, the beloved patriarch of the Kibel family, passed away peacefully Wednesday night surrounded by family and friends. Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12\" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96. On second thought, his memory was not so great for the last 10 years, so maybe the salt was not so good. Henry is survived by his sister, three children, eight grandchildren, and many nephews and nieces.

      "SMITH--Howard. NYU Lutheran's board and staff are deeply saddened by the passing of chair emeritus Howard Smith. As chairman of Lutheran Medical Center and Augustana Center from 1966 until 2004, Smith, who died Thursday at age 85, left an indelible legacy on southwest Brooklyn. With his friend New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the American Lutheran Church, Mr. Smith brokered the 1977 expansion and relocation of Lutheran Medical Center from 4th Avenue and 46th Street to its present location, a former warehouse at 55th Street and 2nd Avenue in Sunset Park. He facilitated the creation of the Sunset Park Family Health Center, now called NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers, the second largest federally qualified health center network in the nation. He created a lasting financial foundation for Lutheran through Health Plus, an innovative government-sponsored insurance program for low-income residents. Lutheran's sale of Health Plus to Amerigroup in 2011 created an endowment that continues to help modernize the health system. Mr. Smith, a lifelong Brooklyn resident, was chairman emeritus of the United Hospital Fund, former president of the Brooklyn Public Library Board of Trustees, and past vice president and director of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Smith received a bachelor's in chemical engineering from Princeton University and served in the U.S. Army. He served 40 years as president of Virginia Dare Extract Company, which was founded by his grandfather Bernard, and was a former director of Dime Savings Bank of New York before it merged with Washington Mutual in 2002. He is predeceased by his wife, Elsie, and survived by his three children, Howard Jr., Jean, and Lilla, and grandchildren. NYU Lutheran mourns as we celebrate Mr. Smith's life and legacy. A wake will be held at Clavin Funeral Home, 7722 4th Ave., Brooklyn, on Tuesday, February 2, at 4-8pm. Services will be held at the Lutheran Church of the Good Shepherd, 7420 4th Ave., Brooklyn, on Wednesday, February 3, at 10 am. 1/3\n",

      "KIBEL--Henry. After 96 years of laughing, loving, shouting, learning, teaching, and building, Henry, the beloved patriarch of the Kibel family, passed away peacefully Wednesday night surrounded by family and friends. Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12\" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96. On second thought, his memory was not so great for the last 10 years, so maybe the salt was not so good. Henry is survived by his sister, three children, eight grandchildren, and many nephews and nieces. The funeral will be held on Friday, January 29 at 11:30am at Frank Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue. We will sorely miss him. The Kibel and Levenson Families 1/3\n",

      "GROSS--Martin L. Martin L. Gross of New London, NH and Ocean Ridge, FL died on Tuesday, January 26, 2016 in Ushuaia, Argentina following a stroke suffered en route to Antarctica. He was 77 years old. Martin's adventures began in New York City where he was born on October 22, 1938. As a young child, Martin and his older brother, Woolf, were dispatched to summer camps and later to working cattle ranches in Utah during the summer months to escape the polio outbreaks that plagued New York City in the years following World War II. After high school, Martin headed north to Cambridge, MA where he attended both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, graduating from the latter in 1964. Before embarking on his first job as a law clerk in New Hampshire, Martin and his first wife, the late Caroline Lord Gross, purchased a Volkswagen pop-up camper and drove to Alaska with Martin's mother, Harriet. Harriet slept in the camper; Martin and Caroline slept outdoors in a tent. After several weeks of abysmal weather the camper was coated with a thick layer of adobe-colored mud. When the trio returned to Concord and washed the car for the first time, it was in pristine condition. Thereafter, Martin never worried much if his car was dirty. Following his clerkship, Martin joined the Concord, New Hampshire law firm of Sulloway & Hollis, P.L.L.C. from which he retired (while maintaining senior counsel status) in 2015 after more than 50 years of distinguished service to his clients and to the New Hampshire Bar. As with everything else in life, Martin viewed the practice of law as an adventure. He delighted in besting his adversaries and often developed long and lasting friendships with them. His in-house writing boot camps were legendary and his wit and charm were ever present at the office and in the courtroom. While working full-time as a Sulloway lawyer, Martin served three terms as the mayor of Concord. During these years, Martin developed a real talent for cooking. This was driven by necessity since Caroline's busy schedule at the State House meant she was often home late. Undeterred by a complete lack of training (and by a lifelong aversion to cookbooks) Martin channeled his inner top chef and produced thousands of wonderful meals for friends and family. The informal \"Sunday Suppers\" he enjoyed with his close friends Malcolm and Susan McLane, Liz and Dennis Hager and other dear Concord friends were a social staple. Six years after the loss of his beloved Caroline in 1993, fate intervened and Martin met his second wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, architect, New London, NH. The meeting occurred at Chicago's O'Hare Airport where both were waiting to board a flight back to New Hampshire. It would turn out to be a kismet flight on United Airlines (friendly skies indeed!) with Deirdre sitting in seat 2B and Martin (who always flew coach and never paid for upgrades) inexplicably seated in seat 3B directly behind Deirdre. Seeing that seat 2A was open, Martin leaned over and graciously asked Deirdre \"Can I buy you dinner?\" They have been having dinner together ever since. This episode gave Martin plenty of fodder for his expansive repertoire of bad puns....\"United\" Airlines.... 2B or not to be.... Martin made the most of it. Six months later, in July 2000, Martin and Deirdre were married. During their 15 year marriage, Martin and Deirdre traveled the world. Despite temporary setbacks (Martin's surgeries, lost luggage, etc.) they visited South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Central America and multiple European countries. This past September, Martin and Deirdre rented an Airstream trailer and toured Grand Teton and Yellowstone parks; they did not have to sleep outdoors. Over the past few years, one of Martin's happiest endeavors was building a warm winter getaway in Ocean Ridge, FL. He loved living in a house designed by his wife, Deirdre. Two weeks ago, Martin and Deirdre left for Antarctica; a trip that was to be Martin's last great adventure. While southbound on his way to Antarctica on a cruise ship he suffered a stroke and had to be transferred to a passing northbound vessel. That ship docked safely in Ushuaia (the cruise's point of origin) where Martin underwent surgery to relieve a subdural hematoma. Despite excellent care and a successful surgery, Martin contracted an infection from which he did not recover. Martin loved the spontaneity and unpredictability of travel. He would have appreciated the irony of his last great adventure. Martin is survived by his wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, of New London, NH; his brother, Woolf Gross (spouse Lucy) of Arlington, VA; a nephew, William Gross, of Arlington, VA; two cousins, John and Charles Gross, both of New York City, and his brother-in-law (affectionately referred to as \"hermano west,\" Hugh McCrystal (spouse Polly). In addition, Martin is survived by dozens of close friends including his childhood friend, Peter Soloman (who Martin always introduced as \"the man I've never not known\"), Will and Sherry Rogers and their two daughters, Anne and Catherine (who were Martin's goddaughters and who lovingly called him \"Uncle Martin\"), Peter and Jean Burling, Rick and Karla Karash, Alex Bernhart and Myra Mayman, Merwyn and Carol Bagan, and others too numerous to name. In honor of Martin's extraordinary service to his community, donations can be made to the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation (on whose board he served for many years), to the Capitol Center for the Arts, to New Hampshire Public Radio, or to the charity of one's choice. Funeral arrangements and information about a celebration of Martin's life will be announced at a later date. 1/3\n",

Sinai Medical School, died on Monday at 79. Born in Montreal, he attended McGill University, edited The McGill Daily, and earned his M.D. at the University of Saskatchewan, where he met Mary, his wife of 54 years. As head of Psychiatry for the New York City Welfare Department under Mayor Koch, he waged a prescient fight against the impending homeless crisis. His patients ranged from celebrities to the indigent, and he was deeply committed to each one as an individual. A broad smile and a winning sense of humor told you instantly that you were in the presence of someone who would sympathetically take the full measure of your being. His stamina was superhuman; he worked long hours and still made himself available round the clock until the day he entered the hospital. His involvement was uncommonly broad, running from child to geriatric, from drugs and talk therapy, to being a pioneer in public psychiatry. Lover of hootenannies, Leadbelly, and opera; gourmet and wine connoisseur; tennis player and fan; magnanimous host and storyteller, Dr. Reich is survived by Mary, two children, Jim and Sharon, and three grandchildren.

Laurence Finberg, a pediatrician and scientist, was known for his contributions to the management of salt and water balance in children. He served as Chair of Pediatrics at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Downstate in Brooklyn from 1982- 1994, and was Dean of the School of Medicine at SUNY Downstate from 1988-1991. A native of Chicago, Dr. Finberg received an SB (1944) and MD degree (1946) from the University of Chicago. In August, 1950 during a major epidemic of poliomyelitis, when he was the Admitting Officer for Contagious Diseases at Baltimore City Hospitals, he took the bold step of integrating previously segregated medical services by admitting an African American adult to previously all white wards, breaking the color barrier. Dr. Finberg served on the faculty at Johns Hopkins from 1951-1963. He became Chair of Pediatrics at Montefiore Hospital and Professor of Pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1963. After moving to San Francisco in 1995, he continued to teach Pediatrics, serving on the faculty of both Stanford and UCSF medical schools. Dr. Finberg was beloved by medical students and residents and as teacher and served as a role model for countless young physicians and aspiring physicians. His work led to life-saving treatment for children, especially children from disadvantaged backgrounds all over the world, who have been the victims of dehydration. Dr. Finberg was Chair of the Academy of Pediatrics Committees on Nutrition and Environmental Hazards. An expert in the diagnosis and treatment of lead poisoning in children, he promoted the idea of testing the environment (obtaining lead levels in paint and other areas in the environment), rather than waiting to find high levels in the blood of children. His arguments against \"using children as the canaries in the coal mine,\" changed the emphasis and undoubtedly prevented disease in many children exposed to peeling paint and poor housing conditions. A gentle man, he was incredibly devoted to his friends and family, and will be remembered for his good natured sense of humor that lightened all occasions. In addition to being a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, he is remembered by his family and friends for his love of chocolate, travel, good wines, and the Chicago Cubs. He is survived by his wife of 20 years, Joann Quane-Finberg, his children Robert W. Finberg, Jeanne Finberg, James M. Finberg, their spouses Joyce, Robert, Melanie, and many loving grandchildren and great-grand children. His first wife, Harriet Levinson Finberg, died in 1994 after 49 years of marriage. 1/3\n",

Richard A. \"Buz\" Cooper, MD, a pioneering cancer research scientist who became one of the world's leading authorities on physician supply and the causes of healthcare disparities, died peacefully at home in New York City on January 15, 2016. During more than 50 years as a physician-scientist, Dr. Cooper had a distinguished and diverse career. He began his clinical and investigative training in hematology and oncology in the 1960s at the National Cancer Institute and Boston City Hospital's Thorndike Laboratory. He later joined the University of Pennsylvania faculty as Chief of Hematology, founded the Abramson Cancer Center, and taught in the Leonard Davis Institute, both at Penn. A native of Milwaukee, Dr. Cooper returned there as dean of the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1985, subsequently founding and directing MCW's Health Policy Institute. Among the first to recognize a potential doctor shortage, Dr. Cooper was a leading authority on the economic and social dynamics underlying healthcare spending and utilization. Increasingly he studied healthcare through the lens of poverty; his book about the effect of income inequality on poor healthcare outcomes will be published by Johns Hopkins University Press later this year. He was preceded in death by his first wife, Jacqueline Cooper, and is survived by his second wife, Andrea Pastor; his current wife, Barrie Cassileth; daughter, Stephanie (David) Cooper Cornelius; son, Jonathan (Eileen Harris) Cooper; and grandchildren, Jordan, Matthew, and Halle Cooper.

      "DRAZEN--Ruth Yorkin. We mourn the loss of Ruth Yorkin Drazen-mother, filmmaker and pioneer in genetics-who died quietly in her sleep on Monday evening at the age of 97. Ruth was born in Washington, PA on May 15, 1918, the daughter of Jesse Sachs Yorkin and Maurice A. Yorkin. Ruth adored classical music from early childhood on, studying piano at the Curtis School of Music with Henry Kaufman. In 1938 she married fellow Curtis student, Mario Berini, and they moved to New York City, where Mario began his career as a tenor with the Met. Their only child, Anton, died in infancy of a rare genetic disease, and Ruth's grief sparked her interest in curing genetic illnesses. She spent years working tirelessly as executive director of The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The National Genetics Foundation. When her second husband, New York attorney Jerome Drazen, died of prostate cancer in 1988, she developed an abiding passion for the subject of humanism in medicine, expressing it through the making of documentary films, which she continued to create into her early nineties. Her first film, \"When Doctors Get Cancer,\" was a sensitive look at doctors treating other doctors, in the hope that it might make more humane the care that physicians gave, when they were able to observe themselves as cancer patients. Five other award-winning films followed, most of them shown on PBS. They included, \"The Choice is Yours,\" the inspirational life of the great psychiatrist, Victor Frankl, \"A Wayfayer's Journey; Listening to Mahler;\" \"Notes From the Edge, the Diary of Peter J. Morgan, M.D.,\" an intimate narrative of the last two years of the life of a 29-year old physician diagnosed with cancer, and \"Healing Through Humanism,\" a five DVD teaching series devoted to the practice of compassionate medicine. Ruth was an intellectual and spiritual inspiration to everyone she touched, and will be sorely missed. Ruth is survived by a son, Myron Drazen and daughter-in-law, Lucille; a sister, Martha Yorkin Berman; two step-sons, Michael and Roger Drazen and seven grandchildren, Julie, Debra, Jacob, Dylan, Emily, Kate and Zoe Drazen. She was predeceased by a son, Anton Berini, as well as brother Alan \"Bud\" Yorkin; husbands Mario Berini and Jerome Drazen. 1/3\n",

After 96 years of laughing, loving, shouting, learning, teaching, and building, Henry, the beloved patriarch of the Kibel family, passed away peacefully Wednesday night surrounded by family and friends. Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12\" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96. On second thought, his memory was not so great for the last 10 years, so maybe the salt was not so good.

      "SLOAN--Howard, WWII bomber pilot, former Chairman of New York Blood Center, died at 91. From a base in East Anglia during World War II, 19 year old Howard Sloan flew 33 missions over Germany. His B-24 was named \"The Stork Club.\" When praised for his bravery, he would invariably respond: \"Was there a choice?\" Cheers erupted from a crowd on the beach when, piloting his plane home to the states after the war, he dipped his wings over the Inwood Country Club. Mr. Sloan was born in New York City on March 20, 1924. He graduated from the Woodmere Academy and Pawling Preparatory School, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, Class of '45W. He and his late wife, Sonny, along with George and Barbara Bush, were the only two married couples on campus. Dreams of business school were dashed by financial necessity and he joined his father's insurance company, Harris, Sloan and Finn. Characteristically, he turned the experience into a colorful one, representing clients such as Restaurant Associates; Richard Burton, who dispatched him to Rome to deliver a diamond he'd bought at auction for Elizabeth Taylor, or Cartier to present a love bracelet to Valentino, who insisted Howard personally fasten it on his wrist. He became an art insurer, developing great interest and knowledge of art in the process, befriending numerous artists and inspiring a lifetime of collecting: Mayan and PreColumbian sculpture, works by artists as diverse as Giacometti and Bill King, Henry Moore and Lindner. He acquired an art gallery, Multiples, for his wife, Sonny, and Marian Goodman to run. In 1990, he was invited by his friend and mentor, Charles Wohlstetter, to become a partner in the latter's acquisitions of hundreds of independent telephone companies from Alaska to California. They formed Continental Telephone, later known as Contel, in 1962. The company then agreed to be acquired by GTE, a combination that created the nation's largest local telephone company. Sloan remained on the Board of GTE until it was restructured as Verizon. In 1968, an American syndicate acquired an 18th century chateau in Bordeaux with Wohlstetter and Sloan installed as new owners. Chateau Bouscaut was the second most beautiful vineyard in Bordeaux, Sloan proclaimed, second, he said, because he didn't want to boast. Among the many American guests who flocked to visit, his favorite was Mary Lindsay, whom he overheard saying to her husband, then mayor of NYC, \"John, if I have to see one more vineyard, I'll kill myself.\" To Sloan's eternal regret, Bouscat was sold in 1980. Mayor Lindsay brought Sloan onto the board of the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1984. At that time, according to Andre Bishop, current artistic director, \"Nobody would give you a nickel for the Beaumont.\" It is now one of the leading theatrical companies in New York, if not the world. Mr. Sloan served on the Board until his death on Thursday. In 1977, Sloan joined the Board of Trustees of the New York Blood Center, of which he was Chairman from 1993 to 2000, nominating his successor, Howard Milstein. In January 2013, a congressional extension prepared by Representative Carolyn Maloney in recognition of Mr. Sloan's 15 years of distinguished service and dedication to NYBC's mission, was entered into the congressional record. She cited his humanitarian status and commended his leadership and tireless advocacy. For several years, he presided as Chairman of Northside Center for Child Development, founded by Kenneth and Mamie Clarke, earning a colleague's recent comment, \"There was a time this place wouldn't have existed without Howard Sloan.\" He and his wife are to be honored for their dedication to Northside at a gala in May 2017. Howard Sloan died of kidney failure in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital on January 21, 2016. Handsome as a film star, he will be remembered for his elegance and extraordinary wit. He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Kathryn Roth of Weston, Massachusetts, Gillis Cone of Woodbury, Connecticut; a son, Douglas Sloan, of Palm Beach; a stepdaughter, Paulette Bartlett Robinson, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren. Interment will be private and a memorial service will take place at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home on Wednesday, February 10th. 1/3\n",

      "SCHWARTZ--Sol. Sol Schwartz, of Sarasota, Florida passed away on December 25, 2015 at the age of 84. Sol was a gifted and prolific artist, the founder of the nationally acclaimed Options college counseling program, a talented musician, a dedicated art teacher and guidance counselor at Sheepshead Bay High School. Sol was the de facto \"artist in residence\" at Tanglewood Music Center in the Berkshires where he created the iconic graphic of Seiji Ozawa now immortalized on Tanglewood's poster. His work has been exhibited at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, MA, at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, numerous galleries, and is to be featured in an upcoming show at Wigmore Hall, London. A selection of his art can be viewed at www.solschwartz.com. The son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, Sol grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side. As a child, he lugged wet wash up tenements to his father's laundry's customers. Sol started drawing at five. He entered New York City's High School of Music and Art. By 16 Sol had joined the New York Mandolin Symphony Orchestra. He starred in the play \"Tomorrow the World\" as a teen. At 35 he studied cello and played in a quartet, and at 60 learned jazz piano. He studied art at Brooklyn College with New York School artists Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, Alfred Russell, and Robert Jay Wolff. Following his graduation in 1952, he taught art and, after receiving a Master's degree in Counseling, served as a guidance counselor at Sheepshead Bay High School. Frustrated by the limited college and financial aid resources available to his students, Schwartz created a program to help the students explore options, navigate applications and obtain aid. Without assistance from the public school administration, Schwartz designed the Options program, obtained mainframe computer access, and researched college and aid data nationwide. He integrated a culture of participation and giving back: seniors worked and assisted the younger students in the Options office. It was the first of its kind in the country. After Options was instituted, students gained entrance to elite universities, graduated without debilitating debt, and achieved significant careers in the arts, investment banking, teaching, medicine and public health. Sol's Options program relocated to New York City's Goddard Riverside in 1985 where Sol built it into the gold standard college access program that today is a key partner to Michelle Obama's Reach Higher Initiative. The program remains as Sol intended it: non-profit, free of charge, available to all, providing the finest level of college and financial aid counseling services, all delivered free with one proviso, that Options' recipients give back to others when they can. After retiring from the school system, Sol returned to his first love: drawing. Combining his love of art with his love of music, theatre and dance, Sol began bringing a sketchbook to performances. Through the years he has sketched Andre Previn, Itzhak Perlman, Emanual Ax, Seiji Ozawa, Yo-Yo Ma, James Levine, Kurt Mazur, Katherine Dunham, Savion Glover, Mark Morris, the Juilliard and Emerson string quartets and others in performance. Sol said he drew during performances to convey \"the spirit of the concert that ineffable nature of a great performance. \"His art is published in the \"Drawing Music\" series and other books, all of artists drawn in performance. Sol's work is in many of the performers' homes. His art often includes a written comment from performers, such as cellist Sharon Robinson, who wrote \"Sol, thank you for capturing my soul.\" The unique nature of Sol's art - artists captured in performance - is reflected in the dual introductions to his first book, Drawing Music: The Tanglewood Sketchbooks, with one introduction by Joel Smirnoff, the Juilliard String Quartet's first violinist, who wrote \"Schwartz has captured the unique stage and musical personality of each performer. And the sound of music permeates the atmosphere of each portrait...As performers, we as artists are ever grateful that Sol Schwartz has helped our expression linger in the air yet a moment longer. We celebrate him for his work and for his musicality,\" and the other introduction by art critic Colin Eisler, who wrote \"Sol's lyrical lines pay homage to the musician... retracing the mysterious union of individual, instrument and passion...[his] pages let us share the collective joy of hearing and seeing music made, we the beneficiaries of his arresting lines in all their ecstatic freedom and harmony.\" Sol was dedicated to helping people experience the joy of learning. He was a donor to many organizations, including Shakespeare & Company, Children's Book Project, Theater for a New Audience, Kids4Harmony, Norman Rockwell Museum, Tanglewood, Jacob's Pillow, Ringling School of Art and Design, the Guitar Society, Asolo State Theater, La Musica, Perlman Music Program and the Florida Studio Theater. He also quietly helped many others when he saw an opportunity. The force of his interest in people and life, and his determination to help others was palpable. Sol was a loving husband to his first wife Lillian, a devoted father to Risa and David, and a delighted grandfather to John Cortner. After Lillian's death in 1999, Sol married Elayne P. Bernstein, who shared his passion for the arts and generosity, introducing him to Shakespeare & Company in Lenox. MA where he served as a trustee. In addition to his immediate family, Sol is survived by several cousins and countless friends who will deeply miss him. Memorial services will be held in Sarasota, FL on February 13 at 2pm and in Lenox, MA during the summer of 2016. Condolences may be sent to the family at P.O. Box 73, Lenox, MA 01240. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Sol's honor to the Children's Book Project (www.children sbookproject.org, 3433 21st Street, San Francisco, CA 94110), Shakespeare & Company (www.shakespeare.org, 70 Kemble Street, Lenox, MA 01240) and Kids4Harmony (www.berkshirechildren.org, 480 West Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201). 1/3\n",

      "HUDNER--Hope Freeman. Artist, Designer, Mother and Friend. Hope F. Hudner died at home in Little Compton, RI on January 14, 2016 following a thirteen month battle with glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer. Hope is survived by her husband of 40 years, Michael, and her daughter, Bay, who were deeply involved as caregivers and comforters during the past year, and were at her side at the time of her peaceful passing. Hope is also survived by her aunt, Judy Freeman N. Gross; brothers, Ambassador Charles \"Chas\" W. Freeman, Jr. (Margaret Carpenter) and Robert P. Freeman (Inge Reist); their five children and nine grandchildren (Hope's grand-nieces and -nephews); siblings-in-law, Mr. Kennedy Hudner (Jennifer), Ms. Cornelia Futterman (Michael), and Ms. Kristina Beitman (Harty), and their five children. Hope was born on January 11, 1951 in Nassau, The Bahamas, and lived there until age 10, then alternating time in Southern California with years in Providence and Bristol, RI. Hope was predeceased by her son, Michael Ripley (\"Rip\") Hudner, and her parents (father, Charles Wellman Freeman, and mother, Carla Park Freeman, who died when Hope was 20 months old). Hope was largely raised by her two sets of deceased grandparents, Hovey T. and Marjorie W. Freeman of Providence and Bristol, and Edward and Fentress K. Park of Wollaston, MA and Roaring Brook, MI. Hope graduated from The Lincoln School, Providence (1969), Smith College (1973), and also acquired an MFA from New York University. The family lived in New York City from 1974 through 1994, and then resided in Little Compton and Providence, RI. Hope was an accomplished artist and designer with a portfolio including work in graphic, interior, jewelry, and apparel design. These efforts led to her 2013 creation of Hope Hudner Designs, focused on elegant silk infinity scarves. Hope was deeply involved in Rhode Island public service, including, at various times, board and/or development responsibilities at Moses Brown School, Women & Infants Hospital, Rhode Islanders Sponsoring Education (RISE), RISD Museum, Perennial Planters, The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America (Rhode Island), and Providence Preservation Society. Hope's social involvements included membership in the Providence Art Club, Colony Club of New York City, Lyford Cay Club, Sakonnet Golf Club, and Sakonnet Point Club. Hope had great admiration for the natural world and actively cultivated a sense of wonder: she was a faithful student of plants and flowers (as evidenced by the thousands of bulbs planted across Rhode Island, Maine, and New York); she loved sailing with her family and friends (countless excursions on Narragansett Bay and longer trips to Maine, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Ireland number among the most special); and her keen curiosity led her to explore the far corners of the world, from Spain and Taiwan at age 18 to Antarctica at 49, covering every other continent and many countries in between. Hope had enormous energy, deep intelligence, natural grace, and remarkable warmth. She believed that life presented endless opportunity to learn, remarking on the tenth anniversary of her son's death that, \"Each time it rains in our lives, we are given an opportunity for further growth. I am grateful for the challenges in my life as chances to grow and blossom.\" Hope faced her illness with the same fortitude and poise. While she was indeed a lifelong learner, Hope was perhaps most notable as a teacher of these invaluable lessons to the rest of us. Hope felt a profound duty to embrace everyone she encountered with love and kindness, and she shared this love of people and life like water from a fire hose. All within range were enriched by her presence and generosity of spirit. Hope inspired people to think lovingly and boldly on behalf of the larger community, themselves, and their friends, prompting many to find more inside themselves to enhance their own lives and those of others. A college classmate of Bay's said it beautifully in a recent note to Hope: \"You feature prominently as an inspiration for the life I want to live-to pursue my interests, to live fully and with panache, to spend time in nature, and, most of all, to be kind to people. I know I am just one of the many, many people you affect in this way!\" A celebration of Hope's life will be held in Little Compton in early June on a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions in Hope's memory be made to: the Rip Hudner Memorial Fund at Moses Brown School, Providence; Dr. Patrick Wen's Research in Neuro-Oncology at Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston; or a charity of your choice. Above all, the family encourages you to remember Hope by engaging with the world through love and kindness. 1/3\n",

A passion for music set Annette Kaufman on a fairy-tale course from North Dakota to a conservatory in NYC where she met and fell in love with Louis Kaufman, married him at the age of 18-and seldom left his side for the next 62 years. Mr. Kaufman, a Hollywood legend, played principal violin in over 500 films including Casablanca and Gone with the Wind. In his 2003 memoir, A Fiddler's Tale, he wrote that upon his proposal of marriage, Annette replied that she would like to be his accompanist. For the next 62 years, she was. They lived in Los Angeles, CA in a house designed for them by Lloyd Wright where, at the age of 101, Mrs. Kaufman died peacefully on January 25, 2016. The Kaufmans were well known in the Los Angeles pre-and post-war cultural scene. They were the first collectors of Milton Avery and, being softhearted and generous, helped many struggling painters during Depression-era America. In Brussels after the war, they were shown an obscure piece of music by Vivaldi, The Four Seasons; Mr. Kaufman became the first person to record it. A generous benefactor to many cultural institutions including the Library of Congress, the National Portrait Gallery and the Portland Art Museum, Annette was a vivid raconteur of a time in Europe and Los Angeles that, while largely faded from memory, lived on in her ebullient recounting of it. 1/3\n",

Bernard was one of the most prominent dealers in early American furniture, first as a partner in the firm of Ginsburg & Levy, founded in 1901, and then from 1973 until his death with the firm Bernard & S. Dean Levy, Inc., of New York. Over the nearly 70 years as an active dealer, he was able to acquire and place a number of the most recognizable pieces in both private and public collections. He was a friend and advisor to many of the great early collectors, many of whose gifts now form the core of major museum collections. These include The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Bayou Bend Collection, The Winterthur Museum and Historic Deerfield among many other institutions. He was always eager to share his knowledge and enthusiasm with collectors, curators, other dealers and especially his family. His eye for the very finest in Americana will be missed. Bernard was an avid and accomplished tennis player winning many local and regional tournaments. Into his seventies he remained active in competitive tennis attaining a national ranking. Anyone who played with or against him can attest to a strong will and a wicked drop shot. Also, he always had a good joke to tell and enjoyed making others laugh. He will be greatly missed.

As chairman of Lutheran Medical Center and Augustana Center from 1966 until 2004, Smith, who died Thursday at age 85, left an indelible legacy on southwest Brooklyn. With his friend New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the American Lutheran Church, Mr. Smith brokered the 1977 expansion and relocation of Lutheran Medical Center from 4th Avenue and 46th Street to its present location, a former warehouse at 55th Street and 2nd Avenue in Sunset Park. He facilitated the creation of the Sunset Park Family Health Center, now called NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers, the second largest federally qualified health center network in the nation. He created a lasting financial foundation for Lutheran through Health Plus, an innovative government-sponsored insurance program for low-income residents. Lutheran's sale of Health Plus to Amerigroup in 2011 created an endowment that continues to help modernize the health system. Mr. Smith, a lifelong Brooklyn resident, was chairman emeritus of the United Hospital Fund, former president of the Brooklyn Public Library Board of Trustees, and past vice president and director of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Smith received a bachelor's in chemical engineering from Princeton University and served in the U.S. Army. He served 40 years as president of Virginia Dare Extract Company, which was founded by his grandfather Bernard, and was a former director of Dime Savings Bank of New York before it merged with Washington Mutual in 2002. He is predeceased by his wife, Elsie, and survived by his three children, Howard Jr., Jean, and Lilla, and grandchildren. NYU Lutheran mourns as we celebrate Mr. Smith's life and legacy.

A classic \"New Yorker,\" in every sense of the word, Christina was a native of the Upper West Side for over 50 years. She was an avid Riverside Park gardener, a frequent face at Fairway, and knew every sidewalk crack and crevasse of the Upper West Side. The daughter of Vera Federoff, of Ryazan, Russia, and Bertrand J. Laney, of New York City, Christina was born in Hankow, China, on December 28, 1932, her family fleeing China in 1940, shortly after the Japanese offensive. A true explorer, Christina traveled the world with her family, attending schools in China, Panama, El Salvador, and finally, at the University of Texas, and at New York University. It was in 1953, that Christina, in her own words, \"found her Nirvana\"-New York City. For over 30 years, she was involved in the entertainment industry, acting in small movie and television roles, then working behind the scenes in public relations, advertising, and film production. At United Artists, Christina was the Assistant to the Director of Special Projects for six years. She also worked for the Writer's Guild. Christina was a Vice President of Women of the Motion Picture Industry, and won their Dottie Reeves Humanitarian Award for Community Service. Christina's hobbies were manifold. Her diminutive size and powerhouse personality made her a natural spelunker. She was a member of the National Speleological Society for many years. A talented artist and poet in her own right, Christina supported Women in Motion Pictures, and the Curtain Club. She championed dozens of causes including: The Humane Society, The New York Historical Society, Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society, World Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy, and the ASPCA. Christina was a lifelong volunteer for groups such as Channel 13, The Girl Scout Council of Greater New York, and, for 50 years, the Riverside Park Conservancy, where she was honored for her volunteer contribution in her beloved garden on 78th Street and Riverside Drive. Before there was Google, there was Christina. A voracious reader and a fount of knowledge about a myriad of subjects, especially New York City, family and friends could always rely on Christina for an irrefutable answer. Into her 80s, Christina was a brilliant, plucky, feisty spitfire who continued to stimulate her mind by regular attendance at jazz concerts, museums, art galleries, and theater. She was a devoted sister, aunt, cousin, and friend-a tiny woman with a huge spirit, who will be deeply missed. Christina is survived by her older sister, Kera Toline Rogers of Charleston, SC; niece Catherine Anna Toline, husband Leo Lentsch; nephews, John Colin Toline, and son John, Mark Anderson Toline, wife Ann, and son North, and Paul Alexander Toline; and cousins, Barbara Laney Swenson of Hanover, New Hampshire, Ainslie Drummond of Florida, and Irene Morgan Kay of Australia. Christina's ashes will be interred in Moline, Illinois, with her parents and Russian grandmother, Barbara (Babi) Federoff. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in memory of Christina B.

      "AT one of the least likely business meetings ever, a dignified man holding a mug of tea addresses his sales staff, gathered in a funeral parlor. The employees are guys with names like Poot, Bodie and Shamrock; the funeral home is a front (their business only indirectly involves death). Their boss, the upwardly mobile, tea-sipping Stringer Bell, is telling them that although they have lost territory (that is, street corners), they can offset the loss with improved product (better drugs). At the same time, he insists on running the meeting according to Robert's Rules of Order. This results in lines like, ''Yo, yo, String -- Poot did have the floor,'' and other far less polite interjections. The bizarrely funny scene, in tonight's third-season opener of ''The Wire'' on HBO, says a lot about the show's sporadic, off-kilter humor and its consistently expansive vision. Its characters may sound generic: police officers and drug dealers on the crime-riddled streets of Baltimore, where the series is filmed. But over the last two seasons, with its frank attention to race and class, its moral ambiguity and its unabashedly confusing plots that challenge viewers to keep up, ''The Wire'' has become one of the smartest, most ambitious shows on television. With its attention to detail and its shifting points of view -- we spend equal time inside the heads of cops and criminals -- it is also one of the most novelistic, now more than ever before. This season, David Simon, the series' creator and mastermind (and a former Baltimore Sun reporter who wrote the book on which the series ''Homicide'' was based), has included episodes written by three of today's best crime novelists. In fact, the title of crime novelist doesn't really suit these writers; these are literary novelists who happen to write about criminal types, but whose work soars above genre fiction.\n",

But that is what Japanese fans of \"Twin Peaks\" do on group tours to Snoqualmie, Wash., where the now-defunct ABC series was shot. They pretend to be Laura Palmer, the high school homecoming queen whose body, wrapped in plastic, is found as the series opens. Long after interest in the eerie David Lynch series has faded in the United States, Japan is in the midst of \"Peaker\" mania. Several thousand fans attended mock funerals for Laura Palmer in Tokyo and two other cities earlier this year.
